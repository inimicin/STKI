      "abstract": "The performance of constructed wetland and vegetated strip systems for swine wastewater treatment at Pontotoc\/Flatwood Branch Experiment Station was  monitored  for  16 months, weekly  during summer and biweekly  in  other  seasons. A  laboratory  analysis  of  wastewater  constituents  was performed.  Constituent removal efficiencies were determined on  both  a  concentration  and  a  mass  basis.  Removal efficiencies varied among constituents.  overall concentration removals  of  BOD5,  SS,  NH3-N,  O-P04  ranged  from  about  63 %  to 94%.  overall mass removals of all constituents were more than 90%.  Fecal coliform removal was variable.  Overall hydraulic loss  of  83%  was  achieved.  The  open  water  segment  of  the wetland cells enhanced dissolved oxygen (D.O.)  concentration.",
