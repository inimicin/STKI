This study aims to determine the effect of aggregate hydroponic \r\ngrowing media and EC (Electrical Conductivity) nutrient solution on the growth \r\nand production of melon (Cucumis melo L.). This study used Completely \r\nRandomized Design Factorial (CRD) with factorial arrangement consisting of 2 \r\nfactors, namely the type of planting medium (cocopeat and husk charcoal) and \r\nthe EC value (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) mS\/cm, each replicated as much as 3 times to obtain \r\n30 experimental units. The results showed that cocopeat was a planting medium \r\nthat gave the best response on bases of the parameters of fruit weight and \r\nsweetness level with an average fruit weight of 2.46 kg, in addition the use of EC \r\n2 mS\/cm and EC 3 mS\/cm gave the best response to parameters of fruit weight \r\nand sweetness level with an average fruit weight of 2.04 kg and 2.05 kg. Based \r\non these results, the use of EC 2 ms\/cm was chosen as the best treatment, because \r\nit gives maximum results by spending less resources when compared to EC 3 \r\nmS\/cm.\r\nKeywords: cocopeat, conductivity, hydroponics, husk charcoal, melon",

The second factor was mechanical aeration consisted \r\nof three levels: no mechanical aeration (A0), 12-hour aeration (A1), and 24-hour aeration (A2).
