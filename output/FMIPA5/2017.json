This study examines the influence of MF on the growth of\r\ntomato infected by Fusarium oxysporum, fungal pathogen that\r\ncauses Fusarium wilt in tomatoes. This factorial study arranged in a\r\nstripe split plot design. Factors tested consists of long exposure to\r\nthe MF, M (control; 7'48 \"; II'42\" and 15'36 \"), how to infect\r\nfusarium, F (through soaking the seeds and by infecting fusarium\r\nthrough the stem at the age 28 days after sowing (das), and soaking\r\nthe seeds, S (soaking and without soaking for 15 minutes before MF\r\ntreatment). Each unit of experiment was repeated 3 times.\r\nParameters measured were percentage of germination, growth rate\r\nbased on plant height, and fresh weight. Observations were made on\r\nthe plant until 42 das. Data were analyzed of variance followed by\r\nthe least significant difference (LSD) test at α = 1 and 5%. The\r\nresults showed that the interaction between MF and fusarium (MxF),\r\nfusarium and soaking (FxS), and MF, fusarium, and soaking\r\n(MxFxS) did not produce a different response on all parameters\r\nmeasured. Differences in response to the treatments derived from the\r\ntreatment of MF (M), Fusarium (F), and the treatment interaction of\r\nthe MF x soaking (MxS). The MF (M) and the interaction of MF and\r\nsoaking (MxS) significantly effect on all parameters measured at\r\neach measurement. The treatment of Fusarium (F) significantly\r\neffect on germination percentage, and fresh weight at 7 das. \r\nKeywords— magnetic field, fusarium, germination percentage,\r\ngrowth rate, fresh weight.",

      "abstract": "Paraquat is a toxic substance that can cause oxidative damage through increased ROS production. Oxidative damage can be prevented by supplementing with antioxidants, such as taurine and oyster mushrooms. This study aims to determine the ability of taurine and oyster mushrooms in preventing oxidative damage of the liver of mice induced by paraquat. This study uses a completely randomized design. A total of 30 DDY mice were divided into five treatment groups for 3 weeks, namely: 1) control, 2) the oyster mushroom (6.25% in feed and 2.5 g\/L in drinking water), 3) paraquat (20\r\nmg\/kg, IP), 4) paraquat and taurine (15.6 g\/kg) and 5) paraquat and oyster mushrooms. Parameters measured were MDA, glutathione, SOD enzyme levels and histopathological changes in liver. The results showed paraquat increases in liver MDA levels significantly but decreases in liver glutathione\r\nlevels  significantly compared to controls, while taurine and oyster mushrooms reduce the levels of MDA (p<0.05) and increase glutahion levels (p<0.05).  Paraquat also increases the levels of SOD (p<0.05), while taurine and oyster mushroom are able to inhibit the increased levels of SOD\r\nalthough they do not show significant (p> 0.05). Paraquat induces liver histopathology change which is characterized by congestion, hydropic degeneration and cloudy swelling. In conclusion, paraquat causes oxidative damage to the liver, while taurine and oyster mushrooms can prevent the damage.",

The aim of this research is to find out the effect of sea cucumber's steroid extract and 17α methyltestosterone at different temperature to sex reversal to males on juvenile freshwater crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus. This research was designed using Factorial Complete Random Design Method.

The results showed that the most effective use of steroid extracts of sea cucumber and 17α methyltestosterone was at 27°C to increase the male percentage of 75.16% and 73.79% respectively and gave a significant effect on female genital decrease, total length, daily weight gain and biomass.

      "abstract": "The objective of the research was to observe the effects of soil microfungi application on soil fertility. The soil fertility was determined based\r\non nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) content and plant (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) growth. Firstly, groups of microfungi were\r\ndetermined based on their decomposition properties on Coffea robusta. L leaf litters. The research covered several decomposition properties\r\nwhich were (1) substrate weight loss, (2) cellulase activity and (3) xylanase activity during the process of decomposition on the pure culture\r\ndecomposition test. Secondly, the microfungi were grouped based on averages of all properties value paired in all possible ways. The result\r\nshowed that there were 10 groups of fungi (P1 – P10) combined based on their decomposition ability. The groups of fungi (P1 – P10) were\r\napplied on sterile soils to determine the NPK content and on pots to observe L. esculentum Mill growth (plant height, leaf sizes, fresh and dry\r\nweight). The effects indicated majority groups of fungi were able to increase NPK content and growth parameters comparing to that of control.\r\nIt concludes that the application of soil saprophytic microfungi on soils are possible to perform this process and able to increase soil fertility.",

Concentration levels of mucoxin applied in theexperiment were 0ng\/ml, 0.1ng\/ml, 0.5ng\/ml, 1ng\/ml, 5ng\/ml and 10ng\/ml. The bax gene expression assayed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods, whereas protein expression of bax and p53 determined by immunocytochemistry techniques. The\r\nresults showed that in comparison with the control, both bax and p53 proteins increase by mucoxin treatment.It is suggested that mucoxin worthy classified as a promising anti-cancer drug.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Research report on the ecological and behavioral aspects of swallowtail butterfly Papilio peranthus is very limited. This study was aimed to deepen understanding on the reproductive behavior of P. peranthus. Observation of mating behavior was made by releasing virgin males and females into a flight cage. Behavioral activities of the insects were observed visually aided by video cameras. Three experimental trials were applied namely one male met one female; three males met one female; and one male met three females. The results depicted in an ethogram that involves male behavioral acts such as flying for searching female, pursuing, hovering and touching female for courting, mounting and grasping the female, flying in tandem to seek a safe perch, relaxed bellow the female upon manage to insert his clasper, and withdrew from pairs and flew away upon finishing copulation. The male mate-locating strategy developed by butterfly P. peranthus is patrolling. \r\n Keywords: Swallowtail butterfly, Papilio peranthus, mating behavior, mate-locating strategy, courtship behavior, behavioral ethogram"

The research was conducted in October - November\r\n2016 in the Laboratory of Plant Physiology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematics\r\nand Natural Sciences, University of Lampung. This study uses a completely randomized design\r\n(CRD) with 6 degree of concentration of water extract of the fruit flesh guava: control (Citric\r\nacid 2% w\/v), 0% v\/v, 25% v\/v, 50% v\/v, 75 % v\/v, 100% v\/v. Browning index is determined\r\nbased on the absorbance of the extract of apple Malang at a wavelength of 420 nm. Total\r\nsoluble carbohydrate content was determined by the phenol-sulfuric method, while estimating\r\ndehydrogenase enzyme activity by methylene blue method. Levene's test for homogeneity,\r\nanalysis of variance and LSD test was carried out at 5% significance level. Water extract of\r\nguava fruit has the same effectiveness with citric acid 2% w\/v in inhibiting browning apples\r\nMalang. Similarly, the water extract of guava fruit as well as citric acid 2% w\/v has the same\r\neffect on total soluble carbohydrate content and the activity of the enzyme dehydrogenase.\r\nWater extract of guava fruit has the same effectiveness with citric acid 2% w\/v except for 100%\r\nconcentration on reducing sugar level. The final conclusion is that the water extract of guava\r\nfruit has the different characteristics as citric acid 2% w\/v in inhibiting browning in apples\r\nMalang.\r\nKeywords: water extract of guava fruit, browning index, total soluble carbohydrate content,\r\ndehydrogenase enzyme activity.",

Pembuatan Bank Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid (DNA) gajah sumatera di PLG TNWK merupakan langkah awal uji lanjut dalam konstruksi peta filogenetik gajah. DNA telah berhasil diisolasi dari 44 individu gajah sumatera di PLG TNWK dengan metode kolom berdasarkan protokol QIAGEN DNAEasy Kit. Bank DNA hasil isolasi selanjutnya akan dijadikan sebagai bahan dasar amplifikasi dan uji molekuler lebih lanjut. DNA hasil isolasi diuji secara kualitatif dengan elektroforesis gel agarosa 1% yang selanjutnya disimpan dalam -20oC.",

      "title": "THE EFFECTIVENESS OF USING STEROID EXTRACT OF SEACUCUMBER \r\nFOR SEX REVERSAL IN JUVENILE REDCLAW CRAYFISH (Cherax quadricarinatus)",
      "abstract": "The freshwater crayfish, red claw Cherax quadricarinatus is commercially cultured in many tropical countries. Males of this species have larger harvest size than females, so it is proposed to culture of all-male population for increasing yields. However this practice has hindrance, since it is difficult to provide monosex seed in high quantity.To overcome this problem, it is important to undergo a monosex (single gender) cultivation. Although sex of C. quadricarinatus is determined by genetics, sex reversal from females to males can be triggered by using steroid hormone at their early juvenile stage. The research was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of sea cucumber's steroid extract for sex reversal from females to males in juvenile crayfish. The research was designed using factorial complete random design. Two different techniques  in giving the steroid hormone, which are by immersion and oral. Two groups of 1-2 weeks old juvenile of C. quadricarinatus were immersed in water containing various doses of  sea cucumber's steroid extract 2 and 4 mg\/L respectively, and the other two groups were administered diet containing either extract of sea cucumber or 17α-methyltestoterone (MT) in dose of 50 mg\/kg diets. Sex ratio, survival and growth rate were observed at the end of 50 days juveniles rearing in aquaria.  Sex differentiation was determined by visual observation. Data was analyzed by Anova and LSD tests. The results showed that  administration of steroid extract of seacucumber was significantly increased the male ratio of crayfish.  Treatment dose of  2 mg\/L during 18 h immersion was effective to increase male sex percentage from 31.03% (control) to 79.86%. On the other hand, 50 mg\/kg of steroid extract of sea cucumber in the diet was more effective to increase the male percentage up to 75,16% than MT. Growth rate of juvenile crayfish, included total length, daily weight gain and biomass, were also significantly improved, while survival rate was insignificant. Thus, the administration steroid extract of seacucumber by both immersion and oral are effective to increase male sex percentage of juvenile crayfish.",

Nilai korelasi 0,53 – 0,87\r\nmenunjukkan adanya hubungan antara foraminifera dan kemelimpahan plankton terhadap pertumbuhan\r\nterumbu karang di perairan Gosong Susutan, Lampung. FORAM Index (FI) digunakan sebagai\r\nbioindikator kualitas perairan terhadap terumbu karang, nilai FI yang tinggi menunjukkan lokasi tersebut\r\nbaik dan cocok untuk pertumbuhan terumbu karang, 5,04 untuk nilai terendah dan 9,02 untuk nilai\r\ntertinggi.\r\n\r\nKata kunci : Foraminifera bentik, terumbu karang, plankton, Teluk Lampung.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nThis research was held on 1st august until 21st october 2016 at laboratory of Petrologi dan Mineralogi\r\nPusat Penelitian dan Pengembangan Geologi Kelautan (P3GL) Bandung. The sample that being used\r\nwas from pasir timbul and gosong susutan, lampung. The samples of sediment are 32 sets in total, and\r\nwere taken twice on a 4 point around the shore, at a depth of 5m, on the coral reefs from a depth of 7 and\r\n15 meters, plankton samples were taken thrice at 0 meters, 7 meters, and 15 meters, the identification of\r\nforaminifera was using reference books by Barker (1960) and Loebich and Tappan (1994). The results of\r\nthis study was five ordos were found, named Rotaliida, Textulariida, Miliolida, Robertinida, and Lagenida.\r\nA total of 52 species were identified with Amphistegina lessonii as the most abundant coral reefs as\r\nforaminifera identifier. The analysis of data was using PAST version 2:09 and from that aplication was\r\nobtained the diversity index values range from 0,57 to 2,21 uniformity index values from 0,24 to 0,65 and\r\nthe dominance index values from 0,15 to 0,76. The correlation value from 0,53 to 0,87 indicate a relation\r\nbetween the abundance of planktonic and foraminifera to the growth of coral reefs in the waters of\r\nGosong Susutan, Lampung. Foram Index (FI) is used as bio-indicators of water quality on the coral reefs,\r\nFI high value indicates that the location is good and suitable for the growth of coral reefs, with 5,04 for the\r\nlowest value and 9,02 for the highest value.\r\n\r\nKeywords: foraminifera benthic, coral reefs, plankton, Lampung Bay.",

      "abstract": "Diosgenin and taurine are two bioactive chemicals that get high attention in recent decades because it is claimed as an antioxidant, antidiabetic, and pro fertility. The study aimed to investigate the effect of the two substances when used in combination against diabetes-related infertility in\r\nmale mice. By using completely randomized design, 35 Swiss albino male mice divided into 7 groups (n=5). Group 1 treated with distilled water as normal control. Group 2 receive only alloxan as diabetic control. Group 3 only fed diosgenin 20% as diosgenin control. Group 4 treated with\r\nalloxan and diosgenin 20%. Group 5 receive alloxan and diosgenin 30%. Group 6 treated with alloxan and taurine. Group 7 treated with alloxan, diosgenin 20% and taurine. Treatments were given intraperitoneally once daily for 14 days. The parameters assessed including blood glucose\r\nlevels, body and testis weight, spermatogenic cells counts, sperm counts as well as  sperm motility and viablity. The results showed  crude diosgenin extract from C.speciosus in normal mice lowers the number of spermatogonia, sperma-tocytes and spermatids cells in addition to decrease\r\nsperm motility. In alloxan-induced mice, diosgenin ameliorates the blood glucose levels but not effective in normalization of the testicular parameters of the animals. Taurine, on the contrary, was effective both to cope with the blood parameters and testicular disorders in alloxan-induced mice. Application of diosgenin combined with taurine in alloxan-induced mice, at the end of treatment,\r\nmost effective in lowering blood glucose levels compared with other treatment but shows little contribution in normalization testicular parameters. Thus, it can be concluded that crude diosgenin extract from C.speciosus even though combined with taurine has little effect on testicular disorders in alloxan-induced diabetic mice in comparison to the application of taurine alone.",

      "abstract": "Diosgenin and taurine are two bioactive chemicals that get high attention in recent decades because it is claimed as an antioxidant, antidiabetic, and pro fertility. The study aimed to investigate the effect of the two substances when used in combination against diabetes-related infertility in\r\nmale mice. By using completely randomized design, 35 Swiss albino male mice divided into 7 groups (n=5). Group 1 treated with distilled water as normal control. Group 2 receive only alloxan as diabetic control. Group 3 only fed diosgenin 20% as diosgenin control. Group 4 treated with\r\nalloxan and diosgenin 20%. Group 5 receive alloxan and diosgenin 30%. Group 6 treated with alloxan and taurine. Group 7 treated with alloxan, diosgenin 20% and taurine. Treatments were given intraperitoneally once daily for 14 days. The parameters assessed including blood glucose levels, body and testis weight, spermatogenic cells counts, sperm counts as well as  sperm motility and viablity. The results showed  crude diosgenin extract from\r\nC.speciosus in normal mice lowers the number of spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids cells in addition to decrease sperm motility. In alloxan-induced mice, diosgenin ameliorates the blood glucose levels but not\r\neffective in normalization of the testicular parameters of the animals. Taurine, on the contrary, was effective both to cope with the blood parameters and testicular disorders in alloxan-induced mice. Application of diosgenin combined with taurine in alloxan-induced mice, at the end of treatment,\r\nmost effective in lowering blood glucose levels compared with other treatment but shows little contribution in normalization testicular parameters. Thus, it can be concluded that crude diosgenin extract from C.speciosus even though combined with taurine has little effect on testicular disorders in alloxan-induced diabetic mice in comparison to the application of taurine alone.",

This study aimed to find out whether sexual function of women at\r\nperimenopausal age correlated with their ontogenetic factors, such as the age at menarche and parity. \r\nMethods: Women (n=80) from nine villages in district of Lampung Tengah, Lampung Province, Indonesia aged 4050\r\nyears who meet inclusion criteria participated in the study. Predesigned questionnaire was used to assess socio-demographic characteristics, and the female sexual function index (FSFI) was used to score sexual function of the\r\nrespondents. \r\nResults: None of the 80 respondents smoke, consumes alcohol, and has medical records. Based on the FSFI scores,\r\nexcept for one participant, all respondents suffered from sesual dysfunction with the average of total score 18.77. By\r\nusing median score (18.52) the respondents were dichotomized into two categories, high and low sexual dysfunction. The results of Chi-square analysis and logistic regression showed that respondents with the characteristics of age at menarche <15 years and parity >4 children have better sexual-quality in comparison to those with the age at menarche >15 years and the parity <4 children. \r\nConclusions: It can be concluded that early menarche and high parity might contributed to better sexual-quality of\r\nlife in perimenopausal women.",
