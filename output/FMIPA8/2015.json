      "abstract": "The objective of this study is to examine empirically the impact of defense spending on unemployment along with a number of control variables for a set of five selected countries from Asia which include Cambodia, China, Malaysia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. For empirical investigation annual data over the period of 1992 to 2013 are used. While, prior to regression analysis, the data were sensibly checked using sundry of relevant tests. The empirical results reveal that defense spending is not a better option to overcome unemployment problem in most of the sample countries. Thus, the findings suggest that lower defense budget allocation will provide more resources for other sectors which are relatively more productive and can help to improve economic and social welfare of these selected countries from Asia. Besides decreased military expenditures, encouraging domestic investment and discouraging population growth can help reduce unemployment. Remittance appears to have a positive relation with unemployment, the implications of which need to be addressed by policymakers.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Defense Spending, Unemployment, Cross Country Data, Asian Countries",

The best model was found by using the criteria: Mean Squares Error (MSE), Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC.

The company has been trying for a long time to find the best method to predict the production of pineapple weight per hectare by using the information of plant weight. It is well known that the fruit weight has linear relationship with the pineapples plant weight. In this study, the modeling and prediction of pineapples plant weight will be discussed based on some factors. The experiment have been conducted in four difference locations and cultivar classes and varieties, namely location 094D with cultivar class Medium Crown and variety GP1, location 126C with cultivar class Medium Crown and variety GP1, location 158H with cultivar class Small Crown and variety GP1and in location 576D with cultivar class Medium Crown and variety GP1. The age of plants are 15 months of age. From each location 40 data has been taken by method of systematic random sampling. Than from each datum the plant weight (W) in kg, number of perfect leaves (NPL), the length of the longest leaf (LLL) in cm, and the width of the longest leaf (WLL) in cm are measured. From the analysis the plant weight best predicted by using variables NPL, LLL, and WLL in all locations",

      "abstract": "In this study the model of higher dimensional log-linear model is applied to four categorical variables in Education. The data are collected from the alumni data of University of Lampung, from 2010 to 2013 and about 9060 alumni involved. In this study, the variables of interest are: Length of Study with three categories (<4.5 years; 4.5- 5.5 years; and >5.5 years), Field of Study with three categories (Sciences, Social Sciences, and Education), Sex with two categories (Male, and Female), GPA in scale 0 to 4 with three categories ( <3.0, 3.0-3.5, and >3.5). In this study the aims are going to find the\r\nbest model to explain the relationship among the factors. By using hierarchical Log-linear Model Analysis and backward method it was found that the best model for the data with three variables interactions in the model are: Length of Study*SEX*GPA, Length of Study*Sciences*GPA, and Sex*Sciences*GPA.",

The Multi Periods Degree Constrained Minimum Spanning Tree Problem (MPDCMST) is a problem that concerns about finding a minimum networks installations for a certain commodity so that the networks does not violate the reliability restriction whilst also satisfying the fund limitation in every stages of installations. In this paper we proposed three algorithms by modifying Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms. We implemented our algorithms on 300 generated problems with vertex order ranging from 10 to 100, and compared them with those that were already in the literature. The result shows that the algorithms proposed perform  better",
