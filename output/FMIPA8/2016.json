Based on the full column rank and unconstraint model the analysis to  be conducted is: to estimate the parameters, to derive statistics for testing various hypotheses and to derive confidence intervals of the ratio of the linear function of parameters. The estimation of parameters and the statistics for testing some hypotheses are unbiased. Based on the simulation results, it can be shown that the tests are unbiased and in line with the criteria given by Pearson and Please.

Among photochromic compounds that could be used for such purpose are spiropyrans. This paper presents an alternative analysis of 6-nitro-1’,3’,3’-trimethylspiro[2H-1-benzopyran-2, 2’] (6-Nitro BIPS) behavior due to the impact of solvent polarity, durations of ultraviolet(UV) exposure and dye concentration. Factorial design of experiments was used to study the impact of the three factors versus a response (absorbance). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is employed to analyze the results. The results obtained highlighted that concentration and solvent polarity are the most significant variables. In addition this study shows that the interaction effect between the concentration and solvent factors is essential for better interpretation of the experiments. The models are developed from ANOVA and the models fulfilled the assumptions of normality and independence variances.",

The results from the application of this FLVQ through a simulation to identify the probability distributions are very good and can be implemented to a real data.",
