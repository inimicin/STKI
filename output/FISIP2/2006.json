      "abstract": "Liberalization anf privatization are often associated with global demands for termination of state interfenrence in business. The policy results in dispute between neoliberalism anf socialism. Neoliberalism perceives state interference in economic area as bad, damaging, anf inefficient to econo ic life. State, which conducts operation in political power logic, is perceived less or even not give the place for expanding of healthy market structure and competitive. While socialism perceives state as central figure of economic with the centralized planning instrument anf the ownership be on the hand of state. As economic system, socialism can be understood as an economic system in which the means of production, distribution, anf exchange are publicly owned and operated. Since socialism assumes state as the most representative organization, so the meaning of owned and operated by public means the power of ownership and the mode of operation be on the hand of state. As political ideology, in its connection with the economic control, socialism believe that the state should develop the econom ic planning and control on market operation. This paper prove that neoliberalism and the philosophy demands for termination of state, in the rality, suffers a kind of paradox. On one hand, it trusts market excellence so much over state. But on other hand, it requires the active role of state to return the free market idea.\r\n\r\nKeyword: liberalization, privatization, state, economic",
