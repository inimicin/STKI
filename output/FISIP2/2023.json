      "abstract": "The Covid−19 pandemic has become a global problem that requires coordination and cooperation at all levels of government and sectors. In Indonesia, the implementation of Covid−19 handling policies varies in each region. This study aims to analyze the use of multilevel dynamic governance in handling Covid−19 in Lampung Province. The multilevel governance approach is used to analyze the coordination and cooperation between provincial, district and city governments in handling the Covid−19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the dynamic governance approach is used to analyze how the government can adapt to changes during the pandemic. The research method used is qualitative, with data collection techniques through in-depth interviews, observation, and document analysis. The Lampung Provincial Government’s multilevel dynamic governance indicates weak government capacity. During the year-long outbreak, there were no long-term initiatives, appropriate responses, meaningful evaluation follow-up or cross-sectoral coordination and collaboration activities. This research implies that coordination and collaboration are an essential factor in multilevel dynamic governance.",

      "abstract": "The education process does not run optimally in remote areas or places that are difficult to access. Various problems that occur in the education sector, one of which is the lack of teaching staff to educate in schools. Lampung Province is one area that is still facing these problems. For this reason, the Dinas Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Provinsi Lampung issued a breakthrough by launching a program called the Program Lampung Mengajar. In carrying out the Program Lampung Mengajar, because of the incompetence and public perception Dinas Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Provinsi Lampung. The department cooperates with UPT Pengembangan Karir dan Kewirausahaan Universitas Lampung, and Lembaga Penjamin Mutu Pendidikan Provinsi Lampung. This study aims to analyze the cooperation between actors in the Program Lampung Mengajar, as well as the supporting and inhibiting factors for the sustainability of the collaboration. The research method used is a descriptive research type with a qualitative approach. Data was collected through observation, interviews and documentation. Based on the results of the research that has been done, it can be concluded that the cooperation between actors in the Program Lampung Mengajar has been going quite well according to the predetermined plan, but there are still some principles of cooperation that have not been implemented optimally. Factors that support cooperation between actors in the Program Lampung Mengajar are communication, trust, and commitment. Meanwhile, the factor that hinders cooperation is that the authority is not fully owned.",

      "abstract": "This investigation was prompted by the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, which created very rapid changes in the bureaucratic environment. This initial study is intended to explain how the Indonesian bureaucracy responds to changes due to the pandemic. A literature study is used to aggregate some of the findings of the latest research in Indonesia and official and accountable reports on bureaucratic governance. General results show that the bureaucracy in Indonesia is still stuttering in carrying out its functions. When the public requires quick and fair service, bureaucratic formalism, as an effect of Weberian bureaucracy, finds its contradiction. Still, the response required by the public does not accompany it. Further studies must be initiated to formulate an agile and public-centered bureaucratic model in the post-pandemic era.",

      "abstract": "This article analyzes the political practices of oligarchy and elite politics in the context of the 2020 local elections in Indonesia. Despite the high number of Covid-19 cases, Indonesia continued to hold simultaneous local elections, making the regional elections even more controversial. The significance of this research lies in understanding the existence of oligarchic and elite political practices in Indonesia's election administration. The article employs a qualitative method using desk study by analyzing relevant literature to answer the research problem. The novelty of this research is in providing an analysis of the political practices of oligarchy and elite politics in the context of the 2020 local election. The findings indicate that the 2020 local elections were characterized by the re-strengthening of kinship politics, high single candidates, and the involvement of actors with oligarchic interests. These are indications that oligarchic and elite politics are returning to dominate election administration in Indonesia. The implications of this research are essential for understanding the challenges of democratization in Indonesia and the need to strengthen democratic institutions and practices",

The development of a sustainable tourism sector can be implemented through the green economy. In practice, the implementation of this green economy can also be used to increase solidarity among communities. This research then aims to see how green economy initiatives can increase social  solidarity  in  the  tourism  sector  in  coastal  areas.  This  research  will  be  carried  out using a descriptive qualitative approach. The data used in this study come from differentresearch  results  and  previous  studies,which  still  have  relevance  to  the  contents  of  this research. The study resultsthen found that the tourism sector in coastal areas has various challenges and obstacles. However, this problem can be solved by implementinga green economy. Through  environmentally  friendly  practices,  this  can  provide  economic  and social benefits that are more equitable to local communities. Then community involvement can  be  increased  in managingthe  tourism  sector,  thereby  strengthening  environmental awareness and local culture. This,in turn,can increase social solidarity in society.\r\nKeywords:Green Economy, Social Solidarity, Tourism Sector, Coastal Areas",

Outline the model for disaster management in the region and the structure and procedure that will be used to put it into effect in local communities. The R&D method behind this study aimed to undertake a thorough analysis before constructing a brand-new framework for the concept. The province of Lampung was chosen because it has both an established regulatory framework for disaster management and innovative technical programs. New processes and workflows for volunteer coordination were defined and tested in collaboration with the Indonesia Community disaster and other volunteer group as the end user, and a platform was developed to support them. Increased situational awareness in real-time via unprompted input from many users is a key benefit of such a system. Not only that, but unannounced participants can join the conversation simply by signing up for a website or portal. The crowdtasking system will not fully trust spontaneous volunteers until the community disaster staff has verified their profiles. As a result, they are given less important and less taxing activities than pre-registered volunteers, and their observations are given less weight.",

      "abstract": "So far, direct assistance provided by the government to the community or poor families in the community is in the form of direct cash assistance. The program is in the form of Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH). However, the assistance is insufficient to have a significant impact on the community in order for the family to become independent. The dynamics of social life are so complex that they experience the spirit of the Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH), which is to make people more independent. Concrete evidence should be a sign that the poor are independent, namely, they will graduate themselves without coercion from anyone. This means that they release the assistance provided by the government in the form of the Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH) without coercion and with full awareness. The graduation process that has occurred and has not yet occurred has become a dynamic that needs to be seen from a scientific perspective, thus providing scientific information about the dynamics that occur in the community of Way Wakak Village, North Lampung Regency. Therefore, to see the dynamics of graduation in the spectrum of knowledge, a study was conducted on ”GRADUASI: Construction Independence Receiver Benefits of the Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH) in Rural Areas” in Way Wakak Village, North Lampung. The study aims provide an overview of the dynamics of graduation that occurs in the midst of the poor, who will later find a formulation to make a more independent society. This study uses a qualitative method with case studies. In addition, this study also uses quantitative techniques in collecting data, both in the form of primary and secondary data. This research was conducted in Way Wakak Village, North Lampung. With this method and the field of study that will be investigated, this study will produce the dynamics of PKH beneficiary families in their social life, whether they are already empowered after the assistance or otherwise. The aim is to know the condition of the community comprehensively and is useful to provide an overview and appropriate solutions that can be offered if the assistance is not significantly successful. Thus, the graduation which is part of the PKH is actually carried out by the community voluntarily on the basis of their independence.",

In the context of students, they are freed to carry out campus activities through 9 Merdeka Belajar-Kampus Merdeka programs, namely; student exchanges, internships\/work practices, teaching assistance in education units, research, humanitarian projects, activities, entrepreneurship, independent studies\/projects, and building thematic real work villages\/lectures. One of the issues that arises as the program progresses is the issue of conversion grades, which are viewed as unfair by some lecturers and students because they must convert courses from the original study program. This research uses qualitative research methods, using the types of strategies according to Kooten, namely corporate strategy, program strategy, and resource support strategy. This research found that Unila has strategies in 4 dimensions according to the Kooten, in the program strategy there are obstacles to the technical conversion of the internship program, but Unila continues to improve by designing the curriculum, technical guidance, and workshops of the MBKM program so that the initial objectives of this program can be achieved.",

This qualitative study uses several data collection techniques,  including  interviews, focus group discussions, and unstructured observation. The results of the study show that in the environmental aspect, there is no integrated environmental management mechanism in Kiluan Negeri Village; in the social aspect, Kiluan Negeri Village has a good enough social capital to start optimizing the potential of the village they have; and in the economic  aspect, the Kiluan Negeri Village holds great potential in the field of the tourism economy. For this reason, it is necessary to establish partnerships (government, private sector, academia, media) and explore collaboration with other villages.\r\nKeywords: village SDGs, social mapping, village potential\r\n\r\nABSTRAK\r\nTulisan  dalam artikel ini  memfokuskan  pada upaya  penggambaran pemetaan  sosial  dalam menemukenali  potensi   Desa   Kiluan  Negeri  dalam  mendukung  pencapaian  Sustainable \r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) desa. Studi ini merupakan penelitian deskriptif dengan pendekatan kualitatif  dengan mengombinasikan beberapa teknik pengumpulan  data, seperti wawancara, diskusi kelompok terfokus (FGD), dan observasi tak terstruktur. Hasil kajian menunjukkan bahwa pada aspek lingkungan, belum adan mekanisme pengelolaan lingkungan hidup yang terpadu di Desa Kiluan Negeri; pada aspek sosial, Desa Kiluan Negeri memiliki modal sosial yang cukup baik guna memulai mengoptimalkan potensi desa yang mereka miliki; dan pada aspek ekonomi, Desa Kiluan Negeri menyimpan potensi besar di bidang ekonomi pariwisata. Untuk itu, diperlukan upaya untuk menjalin kemitraan (kalangan pemerintah, swasta, akademisi, media) dan menjajaki kolaborasi dengan desa lain.\r\nKata Kunci: SDGs desa, pemetaan sosial, potensi desa",

Using recent\r\nempirical data, it describes the challenge of institutionalizing a new set of social capital\r\nand its relationship within the framework of governance quality to address the question\r\nof how social capital is implemented. To answer this question, the authors used qualitative\r\nmethods and case studies to discuss crucial aspects of regulating the institutionalization\r\nof social capital development and the interaction of social capital within the governance\r\nframework that government will adopt. Th e group of independent home-based workers\r\nat the village level was selected based on national policy and program support, which\r\nprovides a comprehensive empirical foundation for observing it inside the village governance\r\nframework. Th e fi ndings show that social capital can improve policy implementation\r\nthrough 2 things: strengthening social capital through affi rmative policy support\r\nand programs for special groups\/forums. Development of a variety of decision-making\r\ninnovations, such as women’s network leadership meetings, village discussions, women’s\r\nschools and an important role in formal planning at the village level. Both are correlated\r\nto the institutionalization of a new value system, relations between institutions, and the\r\nformation of new public values that are more genuine, and reinforce the diversity of previous\r\nimplementation values. Social capital is the most elementary part for the successful\r\nimplementation of public policies initiated by the state. Th e impact is that policy implementation\r\nhas the ability to reduce the socio-economic costs of development, and functions\r\nto synergize the achievement of decent work and self-reliance for groups of women\r\nhomeworkers.",

      "abstract": "1% Overall Similarity\r\nReport Date : Nov 7, 2022\r\nThis study aims to introduce the concept of a social capital-based public policy\r\nenvironment to the study of policy implementation arrangements. Using actual empirical data, it\r\ndescribes the challenge of institutionalizing a new set of social capital and its relationship within\r\nthe framework of governance quality to address the question of how social capital interacts with\r\nenhanced implementation. This study's analysis will focus on two hypotheses pertaining to the\r\nquestion of how social capital is built, the role of government in this process, and how to relate\r\nthe role of social capital within the framework of governance quality. To answer the question, the\r\narticle employs qualitative methods and case studies to discuss crucial aspects of regulating the\r\ninstitutionalization of processes and mechanisms of social capital development and the interaction\r\nof social capital within the governance framework that the government will adopt. The villagelevel\r\nindependent home based workers group was selected due to national policy and program\r\nsupport, providing a comprehensive empirical foundation for observing it inside the village\r\ngovernment framework. The findings demonstrate that social capital can improve and influence\r\nthe success of policy implementation by establishing a mutually exclusive relationship between\r\nthe two and altering the nature and ethics of government deformation, which is directed at two\r\ngovernance orientations: adopting the four stages of capital development, continuing to utilize\r\nexisting local institutions, and presenting female leaders and innovation champions as a strategy\r\nfor institutionalizing a new value system. In addition, implementing a strategy to increase relations\r\nand decision-making capacity at the local level by encouraging public initiative and spirit through\r\nstages of expanding networks, quality meetings and dialogues, capacity building, and integration\r\nof needs by becoming an integral part of village legal planning forums and integrated village\r\ndevelopment programs.",
