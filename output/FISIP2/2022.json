Therefore, the role of DISPORAPAR (Department of Youth, Sports, and Tourism) is needed to help develop tourism and improve Pokdarwis performance. The role of local governments in ecotourism development efforts is based on Article 6 and Article 8 of Law Number 10 of 2009. The research method used in this study is a descriptive research method, with qualitative data analysis. The research method used in this research is descriptive research method, with qualitative data analysis. The results showed that, (1) Pokdarwis performance in ecotourism development efforts through the Youth, Sports, and Tourism Office (DISPORAPAR) Pringsewu Regency can be seen from the level of achievement of targets or goals that have been set by taking into account inputs, outputs, outcomes, benefits and impacts. from the tourist destination of Pringsewu Regency. The results of the assessment obtained from these elements can then be seen and conclusions can be drawn regarding the performance of Pokdarwis in developing ecotourism through the DISPORAPAR program, because if viewed from various aspects the researchers did there were still very many shortcomings.

      "abstract": "The domestic apprenticeship program in Lampung Province still encounters problems, such as the socialization process that is carried out less  than optimally so  that only a few  companies are interested in  collaborating. As a result, the company's recruitment  implementation  has  not  been  able  to  achieve the  specified target.  This  study   aims  to  evaluate   the implementation of  the domestic apprenticeship program and identify the factors supporting and inhibiting the implementation of the domestic apprenticeship program in Lampung Province. The study was conducted with a qualitative descriptive approach using 4  program evaluation indicators consisting of  input evaluation, process evaluation, outcome evaluation, impact evaluation (Wirawam, 2016). The  results of  this study indicate that the overall achievement of  this domestic apprenticeship program is quite good so that this program can be continued by modifying or improving some that are less  effective in order to achieve maximum results\/targets  for the coming year. Supporting factors in this domestic apprenticeship program are supported by complete facilities and infrastructure to support program implementation and are supported by competent instructors in training and guiding participants and inhibiting factors: lack  of human resources, lack of  commitment, domestic apprenticeship programs have not gone hand in hand with independent  campus internship program and insufficient incentives.\r\n\r\nKeywords: program evaluation, Domestic apprenticeship, Competence, Job seekers",

The problem in this study is the implementation and sustainability of KRPL Activities at KWT Asoka Mandiri Makmur, considering the help of KRPL Activities only as a stimulus, which ultimately formed independence in the following years. This research aims to analyze the effectiveness of KRPL Activities as well as the obstacles faced by KWT Asoka Mandiri Makmur. The implementation of KRPL activities on KWT Asoka Mandiri Makmur is considered ineffective. Of the four indicators only meet the criteria on target because the group was formed as a preparatory step for the implementation of KRPL Activities, while for socialization is still constrained by member participation and lack of socialization about organizational management, in the aspect of program objectives have not achieved conformity between goals with realization in the field, and in the aspect of monitoring still lack of supervision, especially at the stage of independence. While the obstacles faced by the group internally are human resources participation, financial resource management, in external aspects encountered obstacles in the form of the Covid-19 pandemic, assistance factors, and natural environmental conditions.",

      "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic that occurred at the beginning of 2020 seems to be a phenomenon that has a significant impact on all countries in the world and various sectors, one of which is the tourism sector which has drastically experienced a broad socio-economic impact. Various efforts to restore the tourism sector are needed through various approaches. However, it is necessary to understand in advance the development of tourism interest in the people of Lampung during the pandemic, which has not ended. This is important as the basis for making policies and decisions in the management of tourist destinations by the government. Therefore, this study aims to determine: (1). How is the pattern of changing interest in travelling during the pandemic? And (2). What are the people’s motivations in determining the choice of tourist destinations after this pandemic period? The research method is carried out with a quantitative approach through a survey method with a questionnaire instrument. Because it is still in the pandemic period, the google form will be used and disseminated online through online communities and social media networks interested in travelling and tourism. In data analysis, quantitative software such as SPSS or Excel will be used, and then data visualization will be carried out so that narratives and conclusions can be generated.",

However, the main challenge for local tourism service start-ups is the analysis of potential customers needed to develop applications with a variety of features in them. There are two forms of tourism service applications, namely in the form of website applications and applications based on android \/ IOS. In the first part, it seems that the information needs analysis of the village tourist destination application is the right choice to do. The results of the study identified that the main profile of potential application users is a group of women who are in the age group of 20-31 years and live in urban areas. In addition, substantially the information needs of respondents are parallel to the main profile of potential\r\napplication users, they need more information on tourist destinations that have visual appeal, are concise and not far from urban areas so that they can support\r\ntheir existence in social media activities",

Questionnaires were distributed to members of the five social media accounts and online networks with a snowball. The data obtained from the google form is recapitulated according to the order of variables and indicators, then verification is carried out on the consistency of filling in the answers. Data that does not fully answer the question is then selected, while intact data is maintained. Furthermore, the data analysis process was carried out quantitatively descriptively using the MS Excel application.",

      "abstract": "Program Gerakan Desa Ikut Sejahtera (GaDIS) merupakan satu-satunya inovasi kebijakan di bidang pembangunan daerah berupa bantuan keuangan yang ada di Provinsi Lampung yang ditujukan untuk memperkuat sekaligus memberi ruang gerak inisiatif Badan Usaha Milik Desa (BUMDes), sebab biasanya program-program yang dibuat oleh Pemerintah Provinsi atau Kabupaten\/Kota di Provinsi Lampung hanya berfokus pada bantuan peningkatan infrastruktur saja sehingga inovasi kebijakan ini seharusnya dapat berjalan sesuai dengan tujuan yang diharapkan dan nilai kemanfaatannya dapat dirasakan oleh seluruh masyarakat desa, khususnya di Kabupaten Pesawaran.\r\nParadigma good governance mengedepankan sinergitas antara state, private dan society serta stakeholders. Adanya sinergitas multistakeholders diharapkan mampu mensukseskan pelaksanaan otonomi daerah. Namun dalam kenyataannya, tidak jarang keterlibatan stakeholders berkaitan dengan pelaksanaan program inovatif dari pemerintah daerah sangat minim. Permasalahan yang ditemukan di lapangan berkaitan dengan pelaksanaan program Desa Maju Andan Jejama Gerakan Desa Ikut Sejahtera (GaDIS) yaitu belum adanya administrasi & standard operating prosedur (SOP) per unit usaha dan manajemen usaha yang buruk masih mewarnai kinerja beberapa badan usaha milik desa (BUMDes) di desa-desa di Kabupaten Pesawaran. Keberhasilan dan kesuksesan pelaksanaan inovasi memerlukan sinergitas stakeholders yaitu antara pemerintah (negara), masyarakat, dan swasta. Namun pada kenyataannya dari beberapa penelitian yang kami lakukan, peran pihak swasta (private) masih minim keterlibatannya..\r\nBuku ini dimaksudkan sebagai referensi untuk mengkaji sinergitas stakeholder dalam pelaksanaan program Desa Maju Andan Jejama Gerakan Desa Ikut Sejahtera (GaDIS) di Kabupaten Pesawaran, Propinsi Lampung,\r\nKeseluruhan bab dalam buku hasil penelitian ini berisi uraian fakta-fakta empiris yang diambil dari hasil-hasil penelitian dan diperkuat melalui kajian literatur yang relevan. Melalui hasil-hasil penelitian yang dilakukan penulis dan beberapa peneliti sebelumnya; yang disajikan dalam buku ini, penulis mengajak para pembaca untuk mendeskripsikan, mengelaborasi terkait pentingnya sinergitas stakeholder dalam pelaksanaan program Desa Maju Andan Jejama Gerakan Desa Ikut Sejahtera (GaDIS) di Kabupaten Pesawaran, di ukur dari indikator komunikasi, pelaksanaan program GaDIS berjalan cukup baik yang dapat dilihat dari hubungan antar aktor pentahelix yang berjalan sesuai dengan tujuan. Para aktor pentahelix melakukan komunikasi antar pihak yang turut terlibat dalam pelaksanaan program GaDIS secara virtual maupun tatap muka. Koordinasi dalam pelaksanaan program GaDIS belum berjalan secara optimal, sebab seluruh aktor pentahelix yang terlibat dalam pelaksanaan program GaDIS cenderung berjalan dengan hanya melibatkan beberapa aktor saja, beberapa aktor pentahelix yang turut terlibat cenderung berjalan masing-masing.\r\nKehadiran buku hasil penelitian ini dihadapan para pembaca, diharapkan dapat membuka wawasan tentang pentingnya sinergitas stakeholder dalam pelaksanaan program\r\n \r\nDesa Maju Andan Jejama Gerakan Desa Ikut Sejahtera (GaDIS) di Kabupaten Pesawaran, Propinsi Lampung,\r\nSemua pihak menyadari bahwa inovasi pembangunan daerah merupakan tanggungjawab semua pihak. Semoga buku ini berguna bagi pembaca, khususnya yang memberikan perhatian pada sinergitas stakeholder dalam kebijakan inovasi pembangunan di daerah.",

Hal ini  termasuk dalam bagian digital influencer yang merupakan salah satu strategi komunikasi oleh Kementerian Pariwisata. Orang-orang tersebut (milenial) nantinya akan mengunggah foto atau video mereka selama berada di desa wisata “kampoeng kopi” Rigis Jaya dengan menyertakan komentar yang positif untuk membangun citra destinasiKemampuan analisis peserta ini secara singkat dapat ditingkatkan terutama dalam aspek \r\nkognitif dan afektif. Secara kognitif rata-rata mengalami kenaikan tertinggi sekitar 30,5% dari kemampuan dasar peserta Antusiasme dan semangat peserta pelatihan merupakan salah satu indikator bahwa \r\npelaksanaan kegiatan bisa di katakan “berhasil” dan adanya keinginan untuk tetap dilanjutkan  di tahun yang akan datang\r\n  Adapun saran\/rekomendasi yang penting dari kegiatan ini adalah : Perlunya bimbingan dan pendampingan secara berkelanjutan bagi milenial yang tergabung dalam pokdarwis dan karang taruna dalam rangka pengembangan potensi pariwisata unggulan Kampoeng Kopi \r\nKey words : pendidikan dan pelatihan, millennial, cross cutting interpreters",

Local governments must be able to deal with Covid-19. This study aims to assess the capacity of the Lampung Provincial Government in dealing with Covid-19. Government capacity is essential for crisis management, such as during a pandemic. The research approach used is a qualitative method that includes primary and secondary data and focuses on reviewing literature from reliable sources. The findings reveal that the capacity of the Lampung Provincial Government in terms of fiscal capacity, infrastructure, operational capacity, and political capacity is still lacking. The implication is that the Lampung Provincial Government needs to evaluate and prioritize capacity building, especially political capacity in terms of responsive political communication to maintain public trust",

      "abstract": "Pariwisata   merupakan   salah   satu   sektor   yang   berperan   penting   dalam pelaksanaan  pembangunan  daerah  maupun  pembangunan  nasional.  Saat  ini \r\npembangunan   pada   sektor   pariwisata   mayoritas   hanya   mengedepankan pembangunan  yang  hanya  berorientasi   pada  pertumbuhan   ekonomi  yang tidak  jarang  menimbulkan  dampak  negatif  untuk  lingkungan  maupun  untuk masyarakat.   Pembangunan   inklusif   merupakan   solusi   dari   permasalahan tersebut,   sebab   pembangunan   inklusif   berorientasi   pada   pemerataan   hak dengan  melibatkan  seluruh  entitas  masyarakat  dalam pelaksanaannya.  Salah satu    sektor    pariwisata    unggulan    di    Kabupaten    Lampung    Barat    yaitu \r\nAgrowisata  Kampoeng  Kopi  yang  terletak  di  Pekon  Rigis  Jaya,  Kecamatan  Air Hitam.   Pentahelix   dipandang   sebagai   unsur   yang   memiliki   pengaruh   dan \r\nperan yang sangat penting dalam meningkatkan jumlahkunjungan wisatawan ke  agrowisata  kampoeng  kopi  yang  diharapkan  akan  memperkuat  sinergi untuk   mendorong   program   pemerintah   pusat   maupun   daerah   melalui pengelolaan  destinasi   wisata.  Penelitian  ini   bertujuan  untuk  menganalisis sinergitas  aktor  pentahelix  dalam  pembangunan  inklusif  pada  agrowisata \r\nkampoeng    kopi    serta    menganalisis    pola    pembangunan    inklusif    pada agrowisata kampoeng kopi.  Pengumpulan  data dilakukan melalui wawancara, \r\ndokumentasi,  serta  observasi.  Berdasarkan  hasil  temuan  dilapangan,  dapat disimpulkan  bahwa  indikator  komunikasi  telah  berjalan  dengan  baik  antar aktor  pentahelix  dalam  pembangunan  inklusif,  namun  indikator  koordinasi \r\nbelum   berjalan   secara   optimal   sebab   aktor   akademisi   hanya   melakukan koordinasi \r\ndengan  masyarakat  dan  tidak  melakukan  koordinasi  dengan  aktor pentahelix  lain  dalam  pembangunan  inklusif  pada  pengembangan  agrowisata kampoeng  kopi.  Indikator  pembangunan  inklusif sosial  belum  berjalan  secara \r\noptimal dan inklusif ekonomi telah dilaksanakan\r\ndengan baik oleh aktor-aktor pentahelix.",

In responding to the advances of information and communication technology, Badan Pusat Statistik through the Integrated Statistical Service Unit seeks to improve the quality of public services by implementing several strategies to produce the high quality of statistical data services for the community. This study aims to analyze the process of strategy implementation for improving the quality of public services in Badan Pusat Statistik South Lampung Regency and to analyze the quality of public services based on the implementation of these\r\nstrategies. This research is a qualitative descriptive study that was studied using strategy implementation theory according to Hunger & Wheelen (2003) with 3 indicators, namely programs, procedures, and budgets, and the theory of public service quality according to Nurdin (2019) with 6 indicators, namely facilities, reliability, responsiveness , assurance, empathy, and price. The results of this study indicate that the implementation of the strategy to improve the quality of public services has not run optimally because the procedures for implementating the programs are still constrained regarding the mechanism of online service\r\ntime, utilization of service facilities and the lack of actors that involved in the process of implementing the socialization program. Furthermore, the quality of public services that has been provided are in accordance with the dimensions of the high quality of public services related to the provision of supporting infrastructure, reliability, service assurances, empathy, and service prices, but the responsiveness dimension has not been maximally provided.",

      "abstract": "The  local  government  failure  (city  government  level)  to  operationalize  policies  and accelerate the public interest in mangrove restoration into concrete activities contributes to the  inability  to  save  mangrove  forests  from  extinction.  As  a  result,  a  solution  related  to intervention is required as policy implementation design and sustainability, namely how the city  government  can  translate  and  operationalize  various  national  and  provincial  level policies in appropriate local (city) policies, build networkingamong stakeholders, and build the participation of non-government actors, including the community. The study employed a qualitative approach and an interviewing technique with nine informants from government and  non-government  organizations  involved  in  policy  implementation  performance  and sustainability. Data collection was carried out by in-depth interviews and analyzed through interactive   methods.  This   study   concluded   that   future   implementation  designs   must incorporate    policies    into    spatial   plans    for   regional   development    and   gradually institutionalize  them,  beginning  with  the  establishment  of  authorities,  the  arrangement  of hierarchies, agreed-upon limits, and procedures. At the management level, it is necessary to strengthen  the  relationship  between  stakeholders.  This  can  help  mitigate  the  conflict  and foster collaboration. Sustaining the implementation performance in the future will require the   involvement   and   participation   of   non-government   stakeholders,   including   the community,  and  the  adoption  of  best practices  at  the  local  community  level.  Both  will be shared lessons between the government and the community and the key to the sustainability of policy implementation",

      "abstract": "The  local  government  failure  (city  government  level)  to  operationalize  policies  and accelerate the public interest in mangrove restoration into concrete activities contributes to the  inability  to  save  mangrove  forests  from  extinction.  As  a  result,  a  solution  related  to intervention is required as policy implementation design and sustainability, namely how the city  government  can  translate  and  operationalize  various  national  and  provincial  level policies in appropriate local (city) policies, build networkingamong stakeholders, and build the participation of non-government actors, including the community. The study employed a qualitative approach and an interviewing technique with nine informants from government and  non-government  organizations  involved  in  policy  implementation  performance  and sustainability. Data collection was carried out by in-depth interviews and analyzed through interactive   methods.  This   study   concluded   that   future   implementation  designs   must incorporate    policies    into    spatial   plans    for   regional   development    and   gradually institutionalize  them,  beginning  with  the  establishment  of  authorities,  the  arrangement  of hierarchies, agreed-upon limits, and procedures. At the management level, it is necessary to strengthen  the  relationship  between  stakeholders.  This  can  help  mitigate  the  conflict  and foster collaboration. Sustaining the implementation performance in the future will require the   involvement   and   participation   of   non-government   stakeholders,   including   the community,  and  the  adoption  of  best practices  at  the  local  community  level.  Both  will be shared lessons between the government and the community and the key to the sustainability of policy implementation",

      "abstract": "Pandemi Covid-19 yang membuat terbatasnya aktivitas manusia, mengakibatkan terhambatnya proses pelayanan publik. Dengan terus mengikuti perkembangan zaman, maka BPJS Ketenagakerjaan mengeluarkan program berbasis teknologi yakni Pelayanan Tanpa Kontak Fisik (LAPAK ASIK) guna melakukan pelayanan yang optimal di masa Pandemi Covid-19. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk melihat atribut inovasi yang dilakukan BPJS Ketenagakerjaan dalam melaksanakan program Lapak Asik ini dengan menggunakan indikator yang dikemukakan oleh Rogers yang memiliki 5 indikator yakni Keuntungan Relatif, Kesesuaian, Kerumitan, Kemungkinan Dicoba, dan Kemudahan Diamati. Metode yang digunakan yaitu dengan teknik pengumpulan data observasi, wawancara, dan dokumentasi. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa dengan melihat indikator yang ada maka program yang telah dilaksanakan oleh BPJS Ketenagakerjaan Cabang Bandar Lampung memiliki seluruh atribut inovasi dengan berjalannya proses pelayanan yang kembali optimal di masa Pandemi Covid-19. Namun, penelitian ini juga menemukan kendala yang dihadapi dalam pelaksanaan Lapak Asik di BPJS Ketenagakerjaan Cabang Bandar Lampung seperti kendala internal yakni server down, dan kendala eksternal berupa ketidaksiapan sarana peserta dalam menggunakan inovasi.",

In making population administration documents, it is still relatively low, this is due to the lack of public knowledge and public awareness is not yet high. The Population and Civil Registration Office of Bandar Lampung City launched an online innovation, namely through the official website to improve the quality of service to the community and accelerate the making of Birth Certificates and Death Certificates. This study aims to analyze innovation, advantages and the lack of innovation Birth Certificate and Death Certificate in online services. This research is descriptive qualitative research. This research analysis uses five indicators of public service innovation according to Rogers. The results of this study indicate that the online-based birth certificate and death certificate service innovation greatly accelerates services for the community because people can access it anywhere and anytime without having to go to the Population and Civil Registration Office of Bandar Lampung City. The advantage of this innovation is that it reduces offline applicants and reduces queues for services amd the lack of this innovation is that there are still people who cannot use technology and public understanding of procedures or mechanisms is still low.",

The survey was carried out using a questionnaire to groups of college students. The data analysis includes statistical analysis to determine the frequency and description of the survey data obtained.\r\nResults: Several aspects must be intervened from this condition. This is related to managing incentives and financial assistance to student groups. There is a need for planning and adjustments regarding financial aid management. Then, the aspect of stakeholder involvement will be related to the role of educational institutions as\r\nregional, central and non-government actors. The aspect of policy adjustment will intersect with legislative institutions or policies at the regional and central levels.\r\nLimitations: This research is limited to regional scope studies, so it requires comparison with other regions with more adequate educational resources.\r\nContribution: In the future, the model can be developed to\r\nstrengthen the need for a mixed education model by combining\r\ntechnology and a human touch so that the online education model can feel more humanist.",

The program consisted of village forest, customary forest, community forest, a people \r\nforest plantation, and partnership for forestry. This study merely focused on the community forest in \r\nIndonesia. The purpose of this research is to analyze the context and problems during the implementation \r\nprocess of permit delivery for community forests in Gunungkidul, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A qualitative \r\nmethod was used in this research to understand the case of community forests in the study site. Data were \r\ncollected using an interview, non-participant observation, and secondary document. We find that many \r\ngroups of farmers have not received the permit for forestry management because of regulatory constraints. \r\nThe problems are induced by many policies in the forestry sector regulating various forms of forest \r\nmanagement permits contradicting the principle of the decentralized forest management policy. We \r\nrecommend to the government to simplify the process of forest permit management, especially for the \r\ncommunity forest.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Social forestry is one of the programs delivered by the Indonesian government to distribute forest\r\nownership to society. The program consisted of village forest, customary forest, community forest, a people\r\nforest plantation, and partnership for forestry. This study merely focused on the community forest in\r\nIndonesia. The purpose of this research is to analyze the context and problems during the implementation\r\nprocess of permit delivery for community forests in Gunungkidul, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A qualitative\r\nmethod was used in this research to understand the case of community forests in the study site. Data were\r\ncollected using an interview, non-participant observation, and secondary document. We find that many\r\ngroups of farmers have not received the permit for forestry management because of regulatory constraints.\r\nThe problems are induced by many policies in the forestry sector regulating various forms of forest\r\nmanagement permits contradicting the principle of the decentralized forest management policy. We\r\nrecommend to the government to simplify the process of forest permit management, especially for the\r\ncommunity forest.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Social forestry is one of the programs delivered by the Indonesian government to distribute forest \r\nownership to society. The program consisted of village forest, customary forest, community forest, a people \r\nforest plantation, and partnership for forestry. This study merely focused on the community forest in \r\nIndonesia. The purpose of this research is to analyze the context and problems during the implementation \r\nprocess of permit delivery for community forests in Gunungkidul, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A qualitative \r\nmethod was used in this research to understand the case of community forests in the study site. Data were \r\ncollected using an interview, non-participant observation, and secondary document. We find that many \r\ngroups of farmers have not received the permit for forestry management because of regulatory constraints. \r\nThe problems are induced by many policies in the forestry sector regulating various forms of forest \r\nmanagement permits contradicting the principle of the decentralized forest management policy. We \r\nrecommend to the government to simplify the process of forest permit management, especially for the \r\ncommunity forest.",

Hal tersebutlah yang melatarbelakangi aktivitas pengabdian oleh Tim PkM Desa Binaan Universitas Lampung dalam melakukan pendampingan pemetaan sosial aspek lingkungan, sosial, dan ekonomi masyarakat Pekon Kiluan Negeri dalam mendukung pencapaian SDGs Desa. Metode kegiatan yang dilakukan mencakup aktivitas sosialisasi, penyuluhan, hingga pendampingan pemetaan sosial yang dilakukan secara bersama-sama dengan para partisipan. Secara khusus kegiatan pengabdian ini telah mengarah pada beberapa capaian tujuan yang diharapkan. Tim PkM Desa Binaan bersama masyarakat lokal telah berhasil memetakan potensi Pekon Kiluan Negeri yang mencakup aspek lingkungan, sosial, dan ekonomi. Hasil pemetaan tersebut menunjukkan bahwa potensi Pekon Kiluan Negeri cukup menunjang dalam mendukung pencapaian SDGs Desa. \r\n\r\nKata Kunci: pendampingan, pemetaan sosial, Kiluan Negeri, SDGs Desa",

      "abstract": "Merak Belantung Village is one of the villages in Kalianda District, South Lampung Regency which has a variety of tourism potential. However, the current tourism potential of the village has not been optimally utilized by the local community. For this reason, efforts to realize an ecotourism village in Merak Belantung require assistance from academics by involving village community organizations. This is in line with the development of ecotourism villages based on community based tourism (CBT) which emphasizes the involvement of local community participation. This community service activity aims to increase the capacity of local communities in realizing ecotourism village destinations in Merak Belantung. The method of activities carried out includes socialization, counseling, mentoring, to providing equipment for pokdarwis. The socialization and counseling activities were attended by around 34 people consisting of elements of village apparatus and pokdarwis managers. Service activities by focusing on efforts to develop CBT-based ecotourism villages were carried out for the first time in Merak Belantung Village. The service participants looked enthusiastic and actively involved in every series of activities organized by the PkM team. During the outreach and socialization activities, the participants provided a lot of information about the tourism potential of their village. For this reason, the results of this service activity have also mapped the potential of Merak Belantung Village referring to the SWOT analysis and 7 Landscape Analysis. In addition, there is a high commitment among village officials and pokdarwis managers to focus on developing ecotourism villages in Merak Belantung. This service activity brings new understanding in efforts to develop ecotourism villages, especially the application of the CBT concept. For this reason, sustainable assistance is needed in realizing ecotourism village destinations in Merak Belantung Village.",

      "abstract": "Abstract – Efforts to increase education development are an important strategy, especially in priority areas with a low education index. The choice of implementation model is directed at the results of an analysis of improvement, expansion, deepening, and adjustment of the quality of educational activities. This study aims to (1) analyze the strategy for the development of the 12-year compulsory education implementation model, and (2) the trend of the 12-year compulsory education implementation development model used in priority areas. The method used is a survey method using SWOT (Strengths Weaknesses-Opportunities-Treath) analysis and top down implementation analysis. Pesisir Barat Regency, Lampung Province, is a priority area chosen with the consideration that the education index is the lowest in Lampung Province. The results of the study show that (1) the strategies used to analyze educational development in Pesisir Barat district include: Strengths-Opportunities\/SO; Strengths-Treath\/ST; Weaknesses-Opportunities\/WO, and WeaknessesTreath\/WT and (2) the development model leads to a top down model in the form of: a) the availability of Learning Package A, Learning Package B and Learning Package C programs; b) allocation of funds to carry out teacher competence strengthening training and training in cooperation with LPMP\/Higher Education; d) development of school facilities and infrastructure. An implementation model based on analysis and a top down approach is the choice for the successful development of 12 year education in priority areas.

Mangrove forests have economic, physical, and ecological\r\npotential. Several policy designs have been issued to protect and develop the potential of\r\nmangrove forests, but they have not been optimal in protecting and managing mangrove forests.\r\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the quality of the mangrove forest policy in Karang City.\r\nThe research method uses a qualitative case study design, the research period is September to\r\nDecember 2020. The research location is in the coastal area of Karang City Village, Teluk\r\nBetung Timur, Bandar Lampung City, Lampung Province, Indonesia. The data collection\r\ntechnique used in-depth interviews, the determination of the informants was purposive,\r\nconsisting of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, the Lampung Province Maritime\r\nAffairs and Fisheries Service, the Lampung Provincial Forestry Service, the Bandar Lampung\r\nCity Marine and Fisheries Service, the Bandar Lampung City Housing and Settlement Service,\r\nNGOs (Walhi , Mitra Bentala, and Hands) and the Karang City Community. Data has been\r\ncollected through desk review and stock-taking using regulatory impact analysis. The results\r\nshowed at the problem analysis stage; Mangrove forests have not become the main issue, the\r\nlocation of the authority is limited, it contradicts national policies, there are obstacles in the\r\nimplementation and implementer processes. Only 3 policies are used as a basis for policy\r\ndevelopment, integration, and collaboration of 3 key stakeholders in policy development. The\r\nchoice of ecotourism and green open space policy development becomes smart regulation that\r\ncan improve policy quality, transparency, accountability, and costs.",

      "abstract": "The local government failure (city government level) to operationalize policies and\r\naccelerate the public interest in mangrove restoration into concrete activities contributes to\r\nthe inability to save mangrove forests from extinction. As a result, a solution related to\r\nintervention is required as policy implementation design and sustainability, namely how the\r\ncity government can translate and operationalize various national and provincial level\r\npolicies in appropriate local (city) policies, build networking among stakeholders, and build\r\nthe participation of non-government actors, including the community. The study employed\r\na qualitative approach and an interviewing technique with nine informants from government\r\nand non-government organizations involved in policy implementation performance and\r\nsustainability. Data collection was carried out by in-depth interviews and analyzed through\r\ninteractive methods. This study concluded that future implementation designs must\r\nincorporate policies into spatial plans for regional development and gradually\r\ninstitutionalize them, beginning with the establishment of authorities, the arrangement of\r\nhierarchies, agreed-upon limits, and procedures. At the management level, it is necessary to\r\nstrengthen the relationship between stakeholders. This can help mitigate the conflict and\r\nfoster collaboration. Sustaining the implementation performance in the future will require\r\nthe involvement and participation of non-government stakeholders, including the\r\ncommunity, and the adoption of best practices at the local community level. Both will be\r\nshared lessons between the government and the community and the key to the sustainability\r\nof policy implementation",

      "abstract": "Since the Covid\r\n-\r\n19 epidemic, the education system as a whole has had to adapt \r\nto the new way of teaching and learning. Many people, including educators and \r\nstudents, need to take advantage of the new technical tools available to them to \r\nfit into a\r\nnew learning culture. There are two types of learning that place a high \r\nvalue  on  face\r\n-\r\nto\r\n-\r\nface  interactions:  online  and  offline.  When  students  and \r\nteachers are not in the same area, they have to rely on the internet to do online \r\nlearning. The level of teac\r\nher proficiency in online learning is studied in the \r\ncontext of the Covid\r\n-\r\n19 outbreak, as well as how distance learning is applied at \r\nSMPN 16 Pesawaran. When data is given in the form of words and sentences, it is \r\nconsidered a qualitative method. At SMPN 1\r\n6 Pesawaran, the distance learning \r\npolicy has been successfully implemented in accordance with directives from the \r\ncentral government and the Pesawaran city government. Pre\r\n-\r\ndefined techniques \r\nare  used  to  implement  distance  education  online.  Regional  deploy\r\nment  of \r\ndistance  learning  cannot  be  optimized  due  to  lack  of  suitable  facilities  and \r\ninfrastructure in recent years",
