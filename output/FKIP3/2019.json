The type of research used is research and development that refers to the theory of Borg & Gall. The population in this study included fourth grade students in elementary schools in central Lampung. The sampling technique uses a purposive technique. The sample of this study was fourth grade students, amounting to 44 elementary schools in Central Lampung. Data was collected through\r\nquestionnaires and tests. The feasibility of the instrument is theoretically based on the assessment of 3 experts with\r\nan average of 84.32 very good categories. While the feasibility of the instrument empirically based on the analysis\r\nthere are 30 decent and quality MCQs from the results of validity, reliability, distinguishing power, level of\r\ndifficulty, and distractor test. The results of the study showed that the test instruments developed had met the\r\ncriteria for writing proper and quality test instruments to measure students' knowledge.",

The data analysis technique used is the n-Gain test to determine its effectiveness. The results of validating thematic learning tools based on Problem Based Learning are done by curriculum experts and learning experts. The results showed that the product development of integrated thematic learning tools based on Problem Based Learning produced is effective for use in the learning process for fourth-grade students.
