Additional interventions could be an alternative that makes thematic instructions at elementary levels achieve better results. One way that could be applicable is by the use of students’ worksheets which support learning for students. The purposes of study were (1) to test the use of worksheets inintegrated thematic instructions in a scientific approach, and (2) to see the effectiveness of worksheets in\r\nintegrated thematic instruction. This research was conducted by using research and development method in selected elementary schools in Metro, Lampung, Indonesia. The results showed that the students worksheets developed based on scientific approaches, validated by material experts, learning method experts, as well as teachers’ classroom teachers, were found effective to be used in integrated thematic instructions. The students’ achievement and the teaching learning process were found better.",

The type of research used is research and development (R & D) that refers to the theory of Borg & Gall. The population of this study is all fourth grade elementary school students in Langkapura sub-district. Sample were taken by using random sampling technique as many as 56 students of SD Negeri 2 Langkapura. Data were collected through questionnaires and test questions. Questionnaire is used to measure the feasibility of students worksheets and test questions to measure the\r\nimprovement of student learning outcomes. The results showed that students worksheet based on discovery\r\nlearning were developed feasible and effective for learning. This is proved from the results of the acquisition of\r\nquestionnaires by experts and teachers who stated that the development products are feasible based on didactic,\r\nconstruction and technical requirements. As well as the results of the calculation of effectiveness tests that obtain an average gain value of 0.365 which proves that students worksheet based on discovery learning are effective in improving student learning outcomes.",

The aim of this research was to produce and test the effectiveness of development PBL model learner worksheet to improve critical thinking ability of students in fourth grade of elementary school. The method used is research and development (R&D) which refers to\r\nBorg&Gall’s theory. The population in this research is all of students in fourth grade at Kedamaian subdistrict.\r\nThe sample used is 70 students with random sampling technique. The collection of data through questionaire\r\nand written test. The data were analyzed by using N-Gain formula. The results show that PBL model learner worksheet is feasible to use and PBL model learner worksheet is effective to improve critical thinking ability of students.",

Hasil evaluasi diharapkan dapat\r\nmemberikan rekomendasi kepada Dinas pendidikan dan para praktisi pendidikan. Desain\r\npenelitian yang digunakan adalah non experimental. Desain penelitian ini terdiri dari 5\r\nvariabel laten dan 33 variabel manifest. Populasinya mencakup 307 SD di 11 Kecamatan\r\nwilayah Kabupaten Pesawaran. Sampel sebanyak 24 SD pada 4 Kecamatan diambil secara\r\npurposive. Instrumen pengumpulan data yang digunakan adalah kuesioner yang divalidasi\r\ndan conten validity melalui Focus Group Discucion (FGD). Data yang terkumpul dianalisis \r\nmenggunakan Structural Equation Models (SEM). Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa\r\nKondisi Lingkungan Sekolah (KLS), Pelaksana Kebijakan Sekolah (PKS), Kelompok Sasaran\r\nKebijakan (KSK), dan Proses Pengelolaan Organisasi Sekolah (PPOS) merupakan faktor\r\ndinamis pembentuk model yang tepat untuk mengevaluasi IP-SPM SD. \r\nKata kunci: model evaluasi, implementasi kebijakan, IP-SPM-SD",

This study aims to compare the social skills of students using Two Stay Two Stray and Talking Chips learning model by considering the type of assignment. The method that used is quasi experiment with comparative approach. The research design used factorial design. The population of this study are 103 students with a total sample of 69 students. The sampling technique of this research is used simple random sampling. Technique of collecting data through observation. Hypothesis testing used two way variance analysis and two independent sample t-test. The result of data analysis shows that (1) There is the difference of social skill between students who learning using two stay two stray learning model using the type of talking chips model (2) There is the difference of social skill between students who are given the project assignment technique, with the students assigned the portfolio assignment technique (3) There is an interaction between the learning model and the technique of assignment to social skills; (4) There is the difference social skills of students who are taught using two stay two stray learning models are better than students who are taught using the learning model of talking chips on the students that given the assignment of the project; (5) There is the difference social skills of students who are taught using a model of learning type of talking chips are better than students who are taught using a two stay two stray learning model on the students that given portfolio assignment; (6) There is the  difference social skills of the students that given the assignment of the project are better than the assignment of portfolio to the students using the learning model two stay two stray; (7) There is the  difference social skills of students who are given portfolio assignment is better than the assignment of projects to students using learning models of talking chips.",

      "abstract": "The problem of this research is that the portfolio assessment instruments have not been implemented in Mathematics subject appropriately. The research objective is to develop a learning model of portfolio assessment on Mathematics subject based on an effective problem-based learning. This research was carried out at SDN 01 Tanjung Rejo and SDN 02 Tanjung Rejo sub-district of Negeri Agung, Way Kanan regency. This research applied Research and Developmet (R & D) method with stages adopted from Borg & Gall. The population and sample size are taken from 30 respondents. The data collection techniques were carried out with questionnaires and tests. The product results are validated by experts of media, material and language. The instrument is being analyzed by item validity and reliability. The results of the research showed that based on the validity by experts of media, material and language, the developed instruments have been proven 'excellent' and 'good' so that it is suitable for use. The results of the large-scale trial of the developed product and the testing showed that the instrument has a good quality so that it can be used to measure the cognitive abilities of fifth grade students of elementary school.\r\nKeywords: assessment, mathematics, problem based learning",
