      "abstract": "A large body of data concerning oral literature around the globe have been reported. Moreover, in Indonesia, a country with multilingual and multicultural contexts, the study of oral literature has become an important aspect of investigation. One of the oral pieces of literature that exists in Indonesia is Pisaan, an oral tradition that can be found in Lampung, a province located on the southern tip of the island of Sumatra. Although a considerable amount of oral literature research has been conducted in the Indonesian context; however, to our best knowledge, little research has been paid to Pisaan oral literature, which plays an essential role in the Lampung community. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the oral literature by translating and transforming the Pisaan oral literature into lyrics and musical elements to educate future generations. This study adopted a qualitative approach using several instruments, i.e., semistructured interviews and recording tools, for data collection. A total of four women who were cultural activists in the age range of 37–76 years of age took part in the current study. The collected data were analyzed using a content analysis and a melody structure analysis. The results show that Pisaan has simple syllabification, which dominantly consists of consonant–vowel (CV) and consonant–vowel–consonant (CVC). The rhythm of Pisaan is categorized into syllabic time syllables, emphasizing the stress word based on its syllables. From a musical perspective, the Pisaan oral literature has been successfully translated and written into musical notation with the aim of preservation, which, as far as we are aware, has never before been done. However, we realize that the Western music notation in this study only serves as the initial stage of analysis and does not aim to replace the distinctive native-cultural values of Pisaan, offering an alternative instructional path for improving Lampung oral literature teaching methods and a valuable strategy to diversify undergraduate courses through comparable interdisciplinary inquiries. Therefore, limitations and suggestions for future research are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Formal music education often uses systematic teaching methods, a planned curriculum, leveling, organization, and standardized learning stages. From a pedagogical perspective, learning music provides a more imaginative, improvisatory learning structure besides all these standard rules. By capturing the social practice of music in the community, music scholars can enrich their academic experience and ideas about designing informal music learning in the classroom. The gitar tunggal players from Lampung may serve as ideas for those learning music formally. While they lack musical and academic literacy, they also provide useful self-learning concepts. Over the past four years, data for this study were gathered using ethnomusicological methods. Online databases were used in addition to the primary data collected through fieldwork. When designing curricula, music scholars might include the ideas of enculturation and Ethno pedagogy. A useful suggestion for enhancing formal music education is to base instruction on local culture and learn it from vernacular musicians in Lampung.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: Jazz has grown in popularity recently, and its presence in Lampung has been recognized. This condition is reflected in the emergence of jazz music groups and communities such as the 'Rakata Jazz Community' (RJC) and the 'Kalima Jazz Community' (KJC) (KJC). However, the Lampung jazz community has a pedagogical dimension in addition to its musical and social activities. Several researchers have realized that jazz provides an informal music learning format. This research aims to describe the pedagogical dimensions of jazz in the community and the music landscape of the Lampung jazz community, particularly at RJC and KJC. Method: From 2017 to 2021, I have been actively participating in this ethnographic research as a member of both communities. Digital archives and websites were used to supplement the research data. Result and Discussion: The study's findings indicate that the learning environment and experience are the potentials for the Lampung jazz community to develop its members' knowledge. This potential is demonstrated through performance activities and jam sessions at its regular meetings.",

      "abstract": "Music  learning  practices  in  formal  settings,  for  example,  in  the classroom,  generally  apply  structured  and  systematic curriculum-based learning   strategies.   The   entire   learning   process   has   generally   been organized   and   implemented   with   guidance   and   supervision   by   the teacher.  In  Indonesia,  music  learning  in  formal  schools  still  applies  the standardization  of Western  music theory.  In  fact,  music learning practices that offer local pedagogical values provide a very diverse portrait. In higher education, music learning that applies local pedagogy has been going on for  some  time.  The  Music  Education  Study  Program  (PSPM)  of  Lampung University is one of the tertiary educational institutions that has implemented music  learning  practices  based  on  local  pedagogy.  Learning  practices that are also performance-based are carried out with \"informal\" stages and processes.  This  notion  means that  local  pedagogy  is  based  on  informal music  practices  in  Lampung  society.  Informal  music  learning  practices have  not  been  recognized  as  the  curriculum  of  formal  institutions.  This article looks at the concept of Lampung local pedagogy applied in music performance-based   learning   practices   in   formal   areas.   The   central theoretical  perspective  in  this  research  uses  Green's  (2008)  thoughts  on informal   learning   in   the   classroom.   Data   were   collected   through observation and in-depth interviews with lecturers andstudents of levels 2 and 3. As a result, the concept of local music pedagogy that takes place in  music  performance-based  learning  at  PSPM  University  of  Lampung  (1) provides  opportunities  for  students  to  learn  while  creating;  (2)  provides space for collaboration and social participation; and (3) strengthens peer learning in groups.",
