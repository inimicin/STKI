The study was conducted from October to November 2019 at the Laboratory of\r\nBotany, Department of Biology FMIPA University of Lampung. The study was conducted in a\r\n2x3 factorial experiment with a completely randomized design. Factor A is young coconut water\r\nwith 3 levels of concentration i.e. 0% v\/v, 25% v\/v, and 50% v\/v. Factor B is atonic with 2\r\nconcentration levels, namely 0% v\/v and 10% v\/v. As variables are high, fresh weight, dry\r\nweight, relative water content, and chlorophyll content of plants. Levene Test, Variance Analysis\r\nis carried out at a 5% significance level. Main effects and simple effects were analyzed by the\r\nTukey test at 5% significance level. The results showed that the interaction between coconut\r\nwater and atonic had a negative effect on the growth of tomato plants. The results of the"
