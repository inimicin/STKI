      "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to analyze the effect of stock price fluctuations, with the mediation of earnings management on the value of companies listed in the main board energy sub-sector in Indonesia during the 2018-2020 period of covid-19. The research sample uses 31 companies through purposive sampling. The research analysis tool uses SmartPLS 3.0. Based on the results of the analysis, the path coefficient of stock price fluctuations with company value shows that there is an effect of stock price fluctuations on company value. The path coefficient of stock price fluctuations with earnings management shows that there is an effect of stock price fluctuations on earning management. Meanwhile, the coefficient of earning management path with company value, there is no effect of earning management on company value. It also occurs in the path coefficient of earning management as a mediation of stock price fluctuations on company value. The analysis shows that there is no effect of earning management as a mediation of stock price fluctuations on company value. This is supported by the results of testing the third hypothesis which makes earning management as a mediation a negative effect on company value. However, because the results of testing the second hypothesis have an effect on stock price fluctuations on earning management, it can be concluded that earnings management only mediates a small part of stock price fluctuations on company value, although there is no effect of earning management as a mediator.\r\nKeywords: Stock Prices, Earning Management, Company Value, Economic Value Added (EVA) and Covid-19",

Electronic government is one of the strategies to create a more effective government. \r\nMany governments around the globe have applied electronic government, including Indonesia. \r\nAlthough there is various research on the electronic government in Indonesia, only a few studies \r\nhave focused on analyzing the intention to use government websites, particularly the local \r\ngovernment's website. To address the research gap, this paper intends to statistically examine the \r\nintention to use Depok City's website based on the user's perspective by applying structural \r\nequation modelling. This study was carried out using a survey approach. Data were collected \r\nusing an online questionnaire on the Depok's citizens. One hundred twenty-five respondents \r\nparticipated in this study. Data were analyzed using covariance-based structural equation \r\nmodelling. The key findings of this research confirm all developed hypotheses in which system \r\nquality, information quality, and service quality influence website intention to use. The results \r\ndemonstrated in this work provide theoretical and practical implications further elaborated in the \r\nlight of this paper.",

Explanatory research with quantitative methods is the type used in this research, and purposive sampling method is the sampling technique in this study. The sample used is 144 samples of the banking industry in Indonesia that have made an Initial Public Offering (IPO). Data collection can be in the form of documentation in the form of annual financial reports and company annual reports. The analysis technique used is the Structural Equation Model (SEM) using the Professional version of the Smart PLS 3 tool. The results of this study indicate that firm age on financial inclusion has a significant negative relationship direction, while firm size on financial inclusion has a significant positive relationship direction. Firm age and firm size on financial performance have a significant positive relationship direction. Financial inclusion (intervening variable) on financial performance has a significant positive relationship to direction.\r\nKeywords: Firm Age, Firm Size, Financial Inclusion, Financial Performance, and Structural Equation Model (SEM)",

The conflict is a complicated and deep-rooted issue, and during the\r\nNew Order era between 1968 and 1998, there was a great deal of tension between the local activists\r\nrepresented by GAM and the Indonesian Central Government under Suharto’s regime. This prolonged\r\nconflict occurred as a result of both groups having different perspectives on particular issues such as\r\nthe implementation of Sharia law and the distribution of natural resources between the local and\r\ncentral governments. Under Suharto, the Indonesian Government believed that GAM was an\r\ninsurgency movement that aimed to separate Aceh from Indonesia. Conversely, GAM felt that the\r\nSuharto regime was too oppressive after its decision to establish a military operational zone in the\r\nprovince.",
