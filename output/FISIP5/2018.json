      "abstract": "This research recommends governance-based collaborative models through the role of community groups of local community entrepreneurs. This model is created from the weaknesses of the conventional Community Based Tourism (CBT) model through the role of 3 CBT sectors (government, private, non-profit organizations) that often run independently, sporadic, non-continuous coordination, and local community involvement which often overlooked in tourism of its own territory. The implications are seen in the economic success enjoyed only by people from outside the region. This article describes Pekon Teluk Kiluan, one of the leading coastal tourist areas in Lampung Province with coastal tourism base, education, and culture. The object of study is directed to the analysis of collaborative communities as a prerequisite for the reform of tourism governance and the development of tourism management model that is not only sided with local communities but also generates positive economy, financial independence, social preservation, culture and nature (environment). The research method is done qualitatively descriptive. Data collected from private tourism, NGO, government, entrepreneur, and community group by using questionnaire technique, interview, observation, documentation, and processed by using interactive model.",
