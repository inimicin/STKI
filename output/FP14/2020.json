      "abstract": "Sustainable Food Home Area (KRPL) is the concept of optimizing the use of yard locations around the house with a variety of plants, livestock and fish in an area. The research objective is to determine internal and external factors and determine the KRPL program development strategy in Tulang Bawang Barat District. The KRPL strategy development program in Tulang Bawang Barat Regency was analyzed using SWOT analysis. The recommended model for developing the KRPL program is based on the results of the assessment and analysis of natural and environmental resource potential and the potential of the KRPL which is integrated with an analysis of the socio-economic, protection, and partnership aspects of its development. The results of the analysis of the internal factors of the KRPL program are a) strengths (geographical position of KRPL, close to production input providers and consumers, as well as the bargaining position of KRPL to consumers), and b) Weakness (Human Resources), managers and assistance, the influence of pests and diseases, and the use of technology in the implementation of KRPL). External factors of the KRPL program are c) Opportunities (policies in developing the KRPL program, government support, supporting infrastructure, and safety performance and capacity), and d) Threats (use of modern technology, collaboration with companies, cooperation, increases in prices of other products, and impact and changing weather). The KRPL priority strategy improvement program can be carried out by increasing savings by increasing compatibility, optimizing the function of the yard to increase the amount of production, increasing the bargaining position of the KRPL by providing quality products for profit, and marketing products by utilizing existing infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "The availability of sufficient energy sources to grow lactic acid bacteria and spices addition can influence probiotic drinks' characteristics. This study aimed to study the effect of glucose and red ginger extract on honey pineapple skin probiotic drinks' characteristics. This study used a Complete Randomized Block Design (RCBD) with two factors. The first factor was glucose concentration, namely 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% w\/v, while the second factor was the concentration of red ginger extract, namely 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, and 5% (v\/v). The data were analyzed using variance analysis (ANOVA), and the differences between means were determined using the orthogonal polynomials. The results showed that glucose increased total lactic acid bacteria and pH, but decreased the preference score of taste, color, and overall reception, but did not affect those of honey pineapple probiotic juice extract's aroma. The red ginger extract increased the taste, aroma, color, and overall acceptance scores, but did not affect the pH and total lactic acid bacteria of pineapple probiotic drinks. The best probiotic drink was from 2% glucose, and 3% red ginger extract, which had 1.3 x 109 colony lactic acid bacteria \/mL; total lactic acid 0.63%; pH 3.69; somewhat like taste, somewhat like aroma; and somewhat like overall reception.",
