      "abstract": "The research was aimed to study dosage of vitamin E  in egg yolk citrate extender to preserve semen quality of “Boer” goat. The study was conducted at The Instalation of Frozen Sement Production Livestock and Veterinary Service of Lampung Province during  October-November 2005.  A Completely Randomized Block design with four replications was used with six different dosages of vitamin E that were 0.0 g; 0.1 g;\r\n0.2 g; 0.3 g; 0.4 g; 0.5 g\/100ml extender in cooling semen for 18 hours.  The different experiment used five dosages of vitamin that were E 0.2 g; 0.3 g; 0.4 g; 0.5 g; 0.6 g\/100ml extender and four replications in frozen semen. The analysis of Variance and polynom orthogonal test were used to analyse data. The result of this study showed the addition of that vitamin E in the ration up to 0,5 g\/100ml in fresh semen for 18 hours had increased the motility and live-cells. The dosage of 0.41 g\/100ml was the optimum dose in frozen semen. Vitamin E addition did not affect abnormality.\r\nKeywords : Semen, Cooling Frozen Semen, Vitamin E, Semen Quality",
