Study of efforts to increase the competitiveness of small-scale Saburai goat breeders aims to (1) determine the resource potential of small-scale goat breeders and (2) analyze the resource potential of small-scale Saburai goat breeders associated with increased business efficiency. A total of 156 Saburai goat breeders in two districts were selected as respondents by using stratified random sampling method. Based on descriptive statistical analysis illustrated that goat breeders in Tanggamus district been categorized potential breeder (moderate) Saburai goat breeders have implemented efficiently (R\/C = 1,28). Business efficiency as an indicator of the competitiveness of micro-scale goat farming is closely related to the resource potential breeders. Improved resource potential breeders can be achieved by increasing the supply of production inputs, labor productivity and a wide range of technology introduction farm \/ ranch.",

The success\r\nof business development of farm animal cannot be separated from the inluence of genetic and\r\nenvironmental factors. One effort that can be taken to improve the genetic quality of the goat\r\nis through crossbreeding. Crossbreeding is one of good way to improve animal production.\r\nCrossbreeding between female Ettawah grade goats and male boer goats are known with the name\r\nBoerawa goat. Currently Boerawa goat are developed in Tanggamus District Lampung Province.\r\nThe results of crossbreeding are expected to have higher performance than Ettawah grade goat.\r\nHigh performance of growth is the result of genetic inheritance of Boer goats that have superior\r\ngrowth characteristics. This research was conducted using survey method in Gisting, Tanggamus\r\nDistrict Lampung Province. Qualitative data on the morphological characteristics and performance\r\nin a descriptive analysis from observations indicate that the morphological characteristics of goats\r\ncrossing at the post weaning period is better. It can be seen from some morphological parameters\r\nthat were observed, among others; body length, shoulder height, chest circumference, and of\r\naspects of performance; litter size, birth weight, and ADG also showed signiicant improvement\r\nin this Boerawa goat"

Analisis ransum dilakukan di Laboratorium Nutrisi dan Makanan Ternak (NMT), Jurusan Peternakan, Fakultas Pertanian, Universitas Lampung. Desain penelitian menggunakan Rancangan Acak Lengkap (RAL) pola searah terdiri dari: tanpa perlakuan atau kontrol (P0), frekuensi penyiraman air 1 kali (P1), dan frekuensi penyiraman air 2 kali (P2). Berdasarkan hasil penelitian yang telah dilakukan dapat disimpulkan bahwa perlakuan frekuensi penyiraman air berpengaruh secara nyata (P<0,01) terhadap respon fisiologis ternak, dan berpengaruh secara nyata terhadap konsumsi dan pertumbuhan sapi Peranakan Simmental.",

      "abstract": "This study explores if there is an interaction between the genetic potential for growth in Merino lambs and their birth or rearing type. Data consisted of 3,920 singles and 4,492 twins birth type and they were the progeny of 285 sires and 5,279 dams. We found a significant sire by BT interaction with the sire x BT effect accounting for 1.59% and 2.49% of the phenotypic variation for birth weight (BWT) and weaning weight (WWT), respectively. The effect was not significant for post weaning weight (PWWT), scan fat (SF) and eye muscle depth (EMD) with sire x BT effects accounting for less than 1% of the variation. Sire by RT interaction effects were much smaller and not significant for WWT, PWWT and SF, but accounting for 1,83% in EMD, which was significant. Results from bivariate analysis correlations lower than one for expression of weight traits when expressed in singles versus twins, with BT having a slightly larger effect on genotype expression than RT.",

This study was conducted in April 2014 to 1,410 head of beef cattle belonging to 776 farmers. The research used a survey method with primary and secondary data. Analysis data used regression analysis with SPSS ( Statistic Packet for Social Science) program.The results showed that the conception rate in the district Jati Agung is a great identity for 36.03 ± 1.16. Factors that effect conception rates in beef cattle in the district Jati Agung is distance between the cowshed with house that negatively assosiated with factor value 0.003, number of factor concentrate that negatively assosiated with factor value of 0.027, amount of forage factor that negatively assosiated with factor value 0.003, a large area of the cage that negatively assosiated with factor value 0.020, and amount of beef cows that maintained that negatively assosiated with factor value 0.049 and a positive association was never followed a course that positively assosiated with factor value 0.112. The factors that influence conception rates in beef cattle farm level is great on long weaning period that negatively assosiated with factor value 0.013, mating postpartum that positiively assosiated with factor value 0.376, calving interval that negatively assosiated with factor value 0.412, the age of cattle that positively assosiated with factor value 0.006, the first estrus postpartum artificial insemination that positively assosiated with factor value 0.133 and time to insemination that negatively assosiated with factor value 0,406.\r\n(Key words: Conception rate, Beef cows, The factors and value)",

The research method is experimental by design Factorial Randomized Block Design, study the influence of the addition of urea level and duration of incubation in the oil palm fruit fiber for nutrient content and digestibility in vitro. Variables measured, a research study nutrient content, digestibility of DM and digestibility of OM of oil palm fruit fiber amoniasi. Data were analyzed by variance and if the real test followed byDuncan.\r\nThe results of the research showed that the addition of urea level and duration of incubation significant effect (P <0.05) to 50.74% DM and 49.04% OM which is in U4I14.\r\nIt can be concluded that higher levels of urea and the incubation period and digestibility of DM and OM increase. Suggested the use of oil palm fruit fiber is to field research to know how impact in dairy cattle.",

This research was held on 08--19 December 2014  in the CV. Varia Agung Jaya henhouse laying  in  the District of  Seputih Mataram, Center of Lampung  Regency and continued on 20 December 2014--18 January 2015 in the Laboratory of Microbiology, Laboratory of Molecular Biology Faculty, University of Lampung. The study used completely randomized design (CRD) with 4 treatments of  local  probiotics in the diet (0%, 1%, 2%, and 3%) and 5 replications. Data obtained was analyzed using analysis of variance at 5% level and continued Orthogonal Polynomial test at 5% level. Based on these results we can conclude: effect of local probiotics in the diet (0,1,2, and 3%) no significant (P> 0.05) on the weight loss presentage and  Haugh unit of eggs which stored ten days, but significant (P <0.05) on  shell thickness. Increasing the percentage of local probiotic on the ration will improve shell thickness indicated by the regression equation ŷ = 0.42 + 0,24x, with r = 0.68 and R2 = 0.47.\r\n\r\n(Keywords: Local of  probiotic, Shell thickness, Weight loss, and  Haugh unit).",

Evaluation was\r\nconducted at Tanggamus regency as breeding sources for Saburai goat. Result of study\r\nindicated that the area was free from many animal diseases and performance test was\r\nconducted for Saburai goat, however population of Saburai goat was low (13,96%) and\r\nnot more than 80%. It could be concluded that Tanggamus regency have not qualified\r\nyet as breeding sources for Saburai goat. \r\n\r\nKeywords: Saburai goat, performance test, breeding sources",
