Lampung, however, has the potential to develop agrotourism involving industrial plantations and tropical fruit gardens.  Lampung Province is among the main production areas of Indonesian for coffee, black pepper, cocoa, oil palm, coconut palm, rubber, sugarcane, cassava and pineapple.  Moreover, Lampung civet coffee and Lampung black peppers are famous worldwide.  Plantation agrotourism offers beautiful views and the opportunity to participate many activities associated with agriculture such as nursery production, planting, breeding, harvesting and processing.  Good management and sustainable production are key to the development of agrotourism.  Sustainable coffee production and damar resin agroforestry in West Lampung have the potential to develop as agrotourism destinations in Lampung.  Local government already has programs to push agrotourism of exotic tropical fruits such as durian, duku, mangosteen and rambutan.
