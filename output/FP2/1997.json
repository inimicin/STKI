      "abstract": "Response of maturing plants to high temperature stress may be determined by shoot\/root interaction that mediate root senescence. This study elucidated the photosynthesis and yield of wheat (Triticum aesticum L ) under different shoot\/root temperatures. Plants were subjected to 22\/22oC, 22\/32oC, 32\/22oC, and 32\/32oC shoo\/root regimes from 7 day after anthesis until they matured. Viable leaf area was greatly reduced by high root temperature al high or low shoot temperature. Photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and chlorophyll variable fluorescence were deceased more by high root than by high shoot temperature High root temperature promoted senescence and less grain yield. Low grain mass under high shoot\/root temperature was caused by small seed size due to short grain-filling duration and  inadequate photosynthate. In conclusion, root temperature is involved in shoot senescence, which in tum may regulate photosynthate partitioning and gain development\r\n\r\nKey words: photosynthesis, shoot\/root temperature, wheat,",

      "abstract": "Respiration is strongly affected by high temperature. Understanding of the control of respiration at maturing wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L.) is, however, limited and the consequences of changes in respiratory parameters are like to be unpredictable.  Objectives were to investigate the relationship between the rate of respiratory oxygen uptake, the involvement of the alternative pathway, and their interaction with growth and measurement temperature. Plants were grown in controlled chambers and exposed to either 25\/20oC or 35\/30oC day\/night temperature just after anthesis. As growth and measurement temperature increased, the ratio of respiration by the alternative pathway decreased in favor of the cytochrome pathway. Although alternative pathway activity was low at 40oC, the inactivation was reversible.  The stimulation of respiration by high temperature was mediated via the cytochrome pathway and residual respiration.  The association between decreasing respiration rates through maturation and senescence suggests that temperature=dependent respiration is also regulated by the availability of substrates, which is limiting during post anthesis high temperature stress.",
