      "abstract": "The implementation of green schools is a starting point for developing environmental awareness and responsibility, begin with educating students in a healthy and sustainable environment. In this perspective, principal leadership will contribute to embody green school with increasing the pro‐environmental attitudes, clean and healthy living behaviour, and habits of individuals, whether at home, or in school. The main aim of this study is to review research evidence and a conceptual framework of the school leadership that contribute to build sustainability school. The design of this study is qualitative approach with case study method in Lampung Province, Indonesia, specifically in the North Lampung District. This study presents results from interviews, observation, and documentation analysis. We sought to understand how role model and school culture provide education service with a particular interest in the physical built environment of this unique school. We found, however, these factors supported school's ability to develop and maintain green school and linked to the principal's actions as school leader. These factors are important for school improvement, especially for schools in disaster-risk areas, communities are increasingly asked to improve students' awareness to environment",

However, little is known about literature on how to overcome the issues through participation of organizations including\r\nschools. This study aims to investigate whether school-based management in Central Lampung secondary schools, Indonesia, can be used to support the realization of green schools to improve the school quality. This study uses a survey questionnaire randomly addressed to the\r\nteachers to collect the data based teachers’ perceptions. The data gained from 55 teachers are then analyzed. Result shows that school-based management can be used to help support green schools to improve school quality and contribution to global community goals in decreasing\r\nthe negative impacts of the global warming phenomenon.",
