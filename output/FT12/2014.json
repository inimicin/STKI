      "abstract": "Agricultural irrigation plays a fundamental role in ensuring the food security and economy of rural communities.\r\nHowever, irrigation systems in many developing countries suffer from low performance, which eventually\r\nadversely affects their sustainability.\r\nTo gain a more in-depth understanding of performance and sustainability in existing Indonesian irrigation\r\nsystems, a set of assessment was conducted. This incorporated methods of Rapid Appraisal Process and Benchmarking,\r\nan opinion survey, and an asset survey. A triple-bottom line (TBL) sustainability assessment was also\r\nconducted to determine the levels of sustainability and performance shortfall, as well as their causes. Based on\r\nthe results, a set of physical and managerial changes were proposed to improve irrigation system performance\r\nand sustainability. The viability of the proposed changes was assessed further through a stakeholder’s opinion\r\nsurvey and against three key sustainability issues of a TBL sustainability indicator framework: technical and\r\neconomic, social, institutional and legal issue, and environmental, public health and safety. The purpose was to\r\nfi nd an alternative and robust solution that was also preferred by stakeholders.\r\nEventually, a simplifi ed asset management planning (AMP) model was developed, which would enable\r\nwater user associations to implement independently and easily. The AMP, consisting of budget planning and\r\nshort-term planning, was also based on the robust preferred priorities of improving irrigation performance and\r\nsustainability."
