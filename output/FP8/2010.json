      "abstract": "Fertilizer is one of the ways to improve cultural techniques for producing high quality of seed with high early vigor.  The objectitive of N, P,and K nutrient in balanced quantity can improve productivity and quality of seed rice. His research was to know response of three doses of N, P, and K on growth, production, and quality of seed rice of Mayang variety on three locations on North Lampung, and see interaction of both factors.  Treatment arrangement was factorial by randomized complete block design with three replications.  Sub factor is fertilizer (P); there are low fertilizer dose (P1) is farmer fertilizer dose consist 200 kg\/ha urea and 50 kg NPK\/ha; middle fertilizer dose (P2) is recommended government dose consist 250 kg\/ha urea, 100 kg Sp 18\/ha, and 100 kg\/ha KCl; and high dose (P3) is recommended dose for seed production consist 300 kg\/ha urea, 150 kg\/ha SP 18, and 150 kg\/ha KCl.  Mains factor is location, there are Ciamis-Sungkai Utara, Wonomarto-Kotabumi Utara, and Semuli Jaya-Abung Semuli.  Homogenity of varian each treatment analyzed by Bartlett test and to see eaded model by Tukey test.  If all assumption are completely, data will be continue analyzed with BNJ test at level 5%.  Result of research showed that high dose fertilizer is can give growth and seed production better than low dose fertilizer, but nonsignificant with middle dose.  The best location for seed production is Semuli and than Wonomarto, and Ciamis in the last position, but nothing interaction between different of dose and location. Key words: rice, Mayang viability, fertilizer",

This study was aimed at determining AMF population and it’s diversity at oil palm plantation both grown at mineral (government and smallholder plantations) and peat soil (private plantation). Soil samples were taken from 20 points for each plantation.  At each point, top soil at 15 cm depth was collected inside and outside circle weeding for spore isolation and identification. Spores were isolated by wet sieving and decanting method using 350 and 45 µm sieves.  Isolated spores were then counted manually under stereo microscope.  Spore’s morphology and their reaction to melzer solution were used to identify AMF to genus level. Results showed that the highest spore population was found from mineral soil at smallholder plantation followed by peat soil  and mineral soil at government plantation.  There were 8 types of AMF found in mineral soil, while only 5 types at peat soil.  Glomus type 3 and Acaulospora sp were the dominant AMF  found in mineral soil while Glomus type 9 was the dominant  AMF from peat soil. Results obtained also showed that the number of spore inside circle weeding was higher compared to outside circle weeding, however the AMF type found in both sides are the same. \r\nKeywords: Arbuscular mycorrhiza, population, diversity, oil palm",

      "abstract": "Around 7 – 30 % of photosynthate produced by plants was exuded through the plant roots.  Compounds exuded were in forms of polysaccharides, polypeptides, enzymes, and several secondary metabolic compounds.  The presence of aluminum may cause an obstruction on seedling growth and establishment and significantly relate with sugars excreted by the plant roots.  The mechanisms of sugars excretion by the plants was one among several means of the plants to overcome environmental toxicity. This research intended to (1) find out kind of sugars exuded by the soybean roots when underwent an aluminum toxicity; and (2) understand the effects of the increase of aluminum concentration on sugars exuded by the soybean roots. The research utilized a technique of aeroponic mist system.  The treatments were arranged in a 3X2 factorial; the first factor was the aluminum concentration consisted of 0, 0.5, and 1 mM AlCl3.  The second factor was the soybean varieties which were Slamet variety recommended resistant to Al and Burangrang variety susceptible to Al. The treatment combinations were applied in a split plot – randomized complete-block design.  To understand the effects of the increase in Al concentration and the differences of kind of sugars on the varieties, standard error of mean (SEM) statistics were used. The results of this research indicated that sugars exuded from the roots of Slamet and Burangrang soybeans which experienced Al toxicity were glcose (Glc) and galactose (Gal).  Total exuded Glc from Slamet variety was 639.23 µg, whereas Burangrang variety was 899.41 µg.    Total exuded Gal from Slamet variety was 404.78 µg whereas Burangrang variety was 489.85 µg.  The pattern of sugar exudation was different between Slamet and Burangrang with the increase of Al concentration.  The Slamet variety confirmed more tolerant than the Burangrang variety since the Slamet variety increased the exudation of Glc and Gal in response to the increased of Al concentration.  This phenomenon was strengthened by the parameter responses of a lower decrease on root fresh and dry weights, and a lower percentage of killed plants.
