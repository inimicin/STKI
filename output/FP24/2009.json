T e objectives of this research were to diagnose diseases occurring on physic nut\r\nin Lampung Province and to determine their intensity. Field observation was conducted in four\r\ndistricts: South Lampung, Tanggamus, Bandarlampung, and Tulang Bawang. Disease intensity,\r\nwhether expressed as disease incidence or severity, was recorded from plant samples determined by\r\nmaking diagonal lines across the fi eld on which fi ve observation spots were made. On each spot, fi ve\r\nplant samples were observed. Specimens were also collected and placed individually in plastic bags\r\nfor laboratory observation. T e diseases found on physic nut in Lampung Province were cercospora\r\nleaf spot, alternaria leaf spot, fusarium wilt, and bacterial wilt. In addition, leaf malformation\r\nfi rst thought to be viral disease was commonly found in many locations. Further mechanical\r\ntransmission failed to produce similar symptom on tested plants and higher population of mites\r\nwere found on malformed leaves than that in normal leaves. Based on the disease distribution and\r\nintensity, the most likely threatening disease in physic nut cultivation is bacterial wilt. Fusarium\r\nalso caused wilt, but it was only found in one subdistrict with low incidence.\r\n\r\nKey words: Alternaria, Cercospora, fusarium wilt, bacterial wilt, Jatropha curcas diseases",

Seven sites were observed on the incidence of white rot of indicator plants (cassava) . Physical, chemical, and biological soil characters were correlated and regressed with white rot incidence. The results showed that there were correlation between white rot incidence and soil characters such as pH KCl, number of fungal genus (fungal diversity), Ca+, total cation, CEC, and saturation base. Ion Ca+, total cation, saturation base correlated positively with white rot incidence, on the contrary, fungal diversity, cation exchange capacity, and pH KCl correlated negatively with white rot incidence. Thus, efforts to increase fungal diversity, cation exchange capacity, and pH (in acidic soil) could be used as basic strategies to develope intergrated  control of white rot disease.",

(former Erwinia chrysanthemi). It has been recorded as the pathogen, though, the species assignment of the organism in the genus Dickeya had not yet been confirmed. The isolates showed biochemical properties similar to those of E. chrysanthemi bv.1 (= pv. dianthicola), which is now presumed to be D. dianthicola. Through sequence analysis of the 16SrDNA, rpoD and gyrB genes, the potato isolates were allocated within a cluster together with D. dianthicola. Cross inoculation experiment of the potato isolates and a carnation isolate of D. dianthicola showed that both of the isolates can infect potato and carnation, having a tendency of stronger virulence against the original hosts. Therefore, the potato isolates were identified as D. dianthicola. Comparative genetic studies on related Dickeya strains isolated in Japan revealed that they are heterogeneous and some of them could not be allocated to existing Dickeya species.",

      "abstract": "Survey of the papaya mealybug infestation that has been done in more than 100 home yards in Bandarlampung City and vicinity during the period of October – November 2009 informed that the papaya plants in 8 out of 13 subdistricts in the city were in general severely infested by the papaya mealybug. However, the infestation was less severe in areas farther away north or west from the city. No northward infestation was found in Wated Village and Bandarjaya Village (Central Lampung District) nor was it westward in Gadingrejo Subdistrict and Pringsewu Subdistrict (Pringsewu District). The population build-up, invasion, and geographical spread of the mealybug were thought to be associated with the symbiotic activity of either one or more of the six ant genera. This study also recorded that 31 plant genera (other than Carica) of 20 families were found infested by the mealybug, including 5 plant genera that have been previously reported (Hibiscus, Citrus, Capsicum, Persea, and Mangifera). It is clearly shown from this study that such important food crops as Zea (corn), Glycine (soybean), and Manihot (cassava) were also found severely and massively infested by the papaya mealybug.",
