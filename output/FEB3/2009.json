The benefits of scientific development of various concepts\r\nare indicated by the flourish technological findings. Philosophy of science, a branch of\r\nphilosophy, was initiated by Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle and developed up to Popper,\r\nKuhn, and many mores philosophers in 20\r\n century. Tremendous contribution of\r\nphilosophy in its application in practical life, in Indonesia as such, can be utilized for\r\npoverty reduction. One of contributions of philosophy of science in management\r\ndiscipline is to push the subject toward more humanistic, like appreciating customer,\r\nstakeholders of company, and environment.

To name a few\r\nof concept refinement in management are Knowledge-Based Management, Value-Based\r\nManagement, Digital-Based Management or IT-Based Management. In its\r\ndevelopment management discipline receives multiple concepts from other fields of\r\nstudy. The psychology, political science, engineering, and laws are the contributor to\r\nthe management discipline. Therefore, one can say that management is a hybrid science.\r\nCulturally, management has developed according to local wisdom; Japanese style of\r\nmanagement is very famous example. In the context of Indonesia, the students of\r\nmanagement have an opportunity to develop new management paradigm based on \r\nth\r\nphilosophy of Pancasila as national ideology, or the other alternatives, one can also\r\ndevelop management field of study in Syariah-based.  \r\nKeyword: Manajemen Gaya Indonesia, hybrid science, knowledge based\r\nmanagement, Syariah based.",

      "abstract": "Company value or Firm value is a certain condition that has been achieved by the company as an illustration of public trust and shareholders towards the company after going through an activity process for several years, since the company was first established until now. This study aims to determine the effect that occurs between Leverage, Asymmetric Information and Corporate Governance on the Firm Value through Cash Holdings as a mediating variable. The data used in this study are published financial report from 33 manufacturing companies in the Consumer Goods Industry Sector listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2011 - 2017. The conclusion of this study is that cash holdings are only able to mediate the influence of corporate governance with a proxy proportion of the board independence on firm value. Directly cash holding and corporate governance with a proxy proportion of the number of independent commissioners also influence the firm value while leverage, asymmetric information and corporate governance with a proxy percentage of the number of share ownership by managerial does not directly affect the firm value of the company. So as to increase the value of the company, companies should determine the proportion of the right amount of board independence so it can create a good corporate government that can increase value of the company.\r\nKeywords:\r\nFirm Value, Leverage, Asymmetric Information, Corporate Governance, Cash Holdings",
