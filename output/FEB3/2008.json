      "abstract": "People may suffer from overconfidence in their daily activities. According to\r\npsychological research, less informed individuals may suffer from overconfidence.\r\nEmpirical research shows that investors suffer from transaction losses due to\r\noverconfidence. This current research is an experimental research project that addresses\r\nthese issues. According to the research design, all investors are classified into three\r\ngroups based on their scores of overconfidence, namely the less informed investors, the\r\nrational (average) investors, and the more informed investors. In order to observe the\r\nresponses of the groups of investors when they receive valuable information, the research\r\nemploys four different types of treatments consisting of the condition of no market\r\ninformation, the provision of guidance of security prediction, the good news and the bad\r\nnews.\r\n The research demonstrates that the less informed investors are inclined to assess the\r\nprecision of their knowledge and information excessively so that they produce a higher\r\nmean of prediction and price errors than those of the more informed investors in all\r\nexperimental market sessions, except in the market session of good news. The phenomenon\r\nindicates that less informed investors conduct a self deceptive behavior. The result of the\r\nresearch also shows that although the less informed investors have higher mean of\r\nprediction or price errors, they have a chance to gain profit as long as they are able to\r\ndeliver the predicted value of the security accurately which is closer to the market price\r\nthat reflects the expected price of the majority of the market players.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Overconfidence, self-deception, price (prediction) error; transaction losses",
