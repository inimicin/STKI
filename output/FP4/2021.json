      "abstract": "Fermented cassava pulp flour-based composite flour (FCPF-based composite flour) is a composite flour consisting of fermented cassava pulp flour, cassava starch, and xanthan gum which has the potential to be developed as a gluten free flour.  This study was aimed to increase the resistant starch (RS) content of FCBF-based composite flour through the application of the partial gelatinization (PG) autoclaving-cooling process.  Other aims were to characterize its chemicals properties, granular morphology, polarized optical microscopy, amylographic profile, X-ray diffraction pattern and relative crystallinity, degree of starch hydrolysis, and estimated glycemic index (EGI).  The results of the study revealed that PG autoclaving for 15 min and cooling time 72 h was the optimal treatment that increased the RS content of FCPF-based composite flour from 1.75% to 7.31%.   This study indicated that the increasing of resistant starch content of FCPF-based composite flour changed its chemicals properties, granular morphology, polarized optical microscopy, amylographic profile, X-ray diffraction pattern and relative crystallinity; and lowering the degree of starch hydrolysis and value of estimated glycemic index (EGI). Increased the RS content would improve the functional properties of FCPF-based composite flour",

Biodiversitas 22: 3122-3129. This study aimed to estimate the genetic diversity among 24 \r\nclones of Robusta coffee from Lampung, Indonesia, by use of RAPD markers. The clones consisted of 18 local and 6 BP clones. These \r\nBP clones were developed from a breeding program of The Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute. Genomic DNAs extracted \r\nfrom these clones were subjected to polymerase chain reaction and the amplified products were run using gel electrophoresis. Eleven \r\nrandom primers produced clear, reproduceable, scorable bands. Fifty four of 86 bands showed polymorphism and were used to construct \r\na dendrogram based on UPGMA Jaccard's Similarity Coefficients. The genetic base of the population was narrow (average genetic \r\nsimilarity 68.4%), ranging from 26-93%. The genetic similarity of the local clones was higher than that of BP clones. The clones were \r\nclusterred into five groups. Group 1 contained one clone (BP 534), while each of Group II-V contained more than one clone. The \r\naverage genetic similarity of BP 534 to each clone of Group II-V was 41%. The genetic similarity of clones in Group II, III, IV, and V \r\nwere 55.5%, 43.0%, 81.1%, and 80.1%, respectively. This research should be very useful for selecting parents in a breeding program to \r\nproduce better clones of Robusta coffee.\r\nKeywords: Coffea canephora, clones, dendrograms, Indonesia, PCR, similarity, UPGMA",
