      "abstract": "A wide range of cassava derivative products,\r\nsuch as starch and flour, was applied in various food\r\nproducts. Therefore, this research investigated the\r\nprocessing techniques of cassava starch and flour, each\r\nwith the aim of extracting the superior properties and\r\ncharacteristics for a specific end product. By modifying the\r\nexisting procedures with integrated cassava processing\r\ntechnology, the production of both products could occur\r\nsimultaneously. This was renewal processing as unified\r\ntechnology, which implied that one single processing could\r\ngenerate two products at a time. In addition to producing a \r\nsuperior characteristic, the integrated method also saved\r\ntime and cost. In this research, two factors of Completely\r\nRandomized Design (CRD) were used in three replications.\r\nThe first factor was soaking in the flowing\r\nwater\/continuous system (P1) and static water\/batch\r\nsystem (P2). The second was the fermentation time (T) of\r\n24 hours (T1), 48 hours (T2), and 72 hours (T3).\r\nFurthermore, the steps conducted include weighing, brown\r\nand white skin peeling, washing, size reduction, immersion\r\nin continuous and batch systems, fermentation for 24, 48,\r\nand 72 hours, refining\/milling, and starch extraction,\r\nfollowed by the pressing process. The existing slurry was\r\ndeposited for 8 hours, then the starch was extracted. The \r\nstarch and flour were dried in the oven at 60o\r\nC until\r\nreaching a maximum moisture content of 13%. They were\r\nmilled and sifted in a 100-mesh sieve. The results showed\r\nthat the spontaneous fermentation process in the integrated\r\ncassava technology produces the superior characteristics of\r\nmodified cassava starch and flour to the point of being\r\nrecommended as a model. The yield whiteness value, and\r\nswelling power (g\/g) of modified cassava starch and flour\r\nrange from 9.0-12.5% and 30.58-35.44%, 91.34-94.04, and\r\n90.41-91.56, as well as 13.28-14.35 and 14.43-17.44 (w\/w),\r\nrespectively. The amylograph characteristics of the starch\r\npaste included longer fermentation, increasing pasting\r\ntemperature, increasing maximum viscosity (value > 600),\r\ndecreasing breakdown, and increasing setback value.\r\nMeanwhile, for flour paste, it includes longer fermentation,\r\nincreasing pasting temperature, decreasing peak viscosity\r\n(value > 500), decreasing breakdown, and increasing\r\nsetback value.",
