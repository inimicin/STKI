      "abstract": "Child assistance victims of sexual violence play a role in protecting and assisting victims in litigation and non-litigation, both physical, psychological, traumatic and social recovery of victims in fulfilling the rights of victims and restoring growth and development according to their age stages. However, there was a case where a man as a victim's companion from P2TP2A East Lampung, Indonesia, committed acts of sexual violence against the victim he was accompanying. Why does this happen and what are the legal aspects of it? This research uses a qualitative method, the data is extracted through in-depth interviews with victims, victims' companion teams, journalists, women's and children's activist NGOs. The results showed that the companion did not have an educational background as a companion, did not have a child rights perspective, did not have a gender perspective, the institution that recruited him, namely P2TP2A, East Lampung Regency did not have a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in mentoring, weak recruitment of assistants, weak capacity building, weak control of P2TP2A on the performance of assistants, did not have a safe house. In this case, the woman who is the Chief Judge of the Tanjung Karang District Court sentenced the perpetrator to 20 years in prison, a fine of 800 million subsidiary 3 (three) months in prison, chemical castration for 1 year after serving the main crime, paying restitution of Rp. 7,700,000.

      "abstract": "Abstract.  The full level of community participation in rural development is very much needed. Participatory development actually comes from the community, is implemented, monitored and evaluated by the community as well. The implemen- tation of rural development receives intervention by the central, regional, local government, non-governmental institutions and\/or private parties or companies. The development process in Gunung Terang Village, Air Hitam District, West Lampung Regency has been going on for a long time. Based on this background, the purpose of this study is to analyze the trajectory of assisting related parties in the village development process through the implementation of programs and activities in the village. This research was conducted with a descriptive quantita- tive approach and interviews. The main data used is primary data and supported by secondary data from reports and libraries. The respondents involved were 35 peo- ple, selected purposively, namely those who had been beneficiaries of programs or activities implemented in Gunung Terang village. The form of benefits received is not a measure in determining respondents. Meanwhile, interviews were con- ducted with community leaders and former village officials who knew a lot about the development of programs and activities that had been entered and accepted by Gunung Terang Village. The community assistance process has been started since\r\n20 years ago, carried out by local non-governmental organizations and interna- tional NGOs. The forms of programs and activities vary, but they are community empowerment with targets for farmer groups, womenâ€™s groups, and youth groups. Meanwhile, the programs and activities received from the central and regional governments are not community empowerment but rather socialization and\/or infrastructure development. Meanwhile, the private sector or company provides guidance whose system has been standardized by the company, for example the management of coffee plantations, so that it can produce high yields. The poten- tial for village development is local wisdom and social capital which is a local wisdom value to increase community participation and capacity. Thus impacting sustainable rural development."

      "abstract": "ABSTRAK\r\nSecara sosiologis, Covid 19 telah membawa pada perubahan secara cepat, tidak direncanakan dan tidak dinginkan kehadirannya oleh masyarakat. Bahkan keberadaannya menimbulkan kekacauan di  berbagai  bidang  kehidupan.  Ketidaksiapan  masyarakat  akan  perubahan  tersebut  dapat berdampak pada terjadinya disorganisasi sosial  di  berbagai bidang  kehidupan. Ketidaksiapan masyarakat akan perubahan yang terjadi dikarenakan antara lain kurangnya kesadaran masyarakat akan       pentingnya adaptasi untuk meminimalisir resiko bencana Covid 19. Oleh karena itu penelitian ini bertujuan untuk untuk  mengetahui    tingkatan kapasitas    ketahanan a d a p t a s i masyarakat dalam meminimalisir resiko bencana Covid-19 di   Kecamatan Labuhan Ratu kota Bandar Lampung. Riset ini menggunakan pendekatan deskriptif kuantitatif dengan teknik pengumpulan data utama yaitu dengan penyebaran kuesioner atau angket. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukan bahwa Tingkat kapasitas ketahanan masyarakat di Kecamatan Labuhan Ratu tergolong tinggi dengan nilai lebih dari sama dengan 120 sebanyak 39 orang atau 97 persen. Dengan begitu kapasitas ketahanan adaptif yang dilakukan masyarakat juga tinggi",
