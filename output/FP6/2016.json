The number of respondents  in this study was taken by cencus method, in which all 62 farmer members and all 35 farmer nonmembers were involved.   The research data was collected during October 2015 - January 2016 and was analyzed  by  R  \/  C  ratios,  different  test  (independent  t-test),  multiple  linear  regression  using  the  Cobb Douglas production function and NPM \/ Px ratio.   The results showed that tomato farming was profitable business and profitability of farmer group members was higher than nonmembers’ farmers.  Land and labor significantly affected the production of tomatoes.  Tomato farming of farmer group members currently on the scale  of production  decreased  (decreasing  returns  to scale)  and the nonmembers’  farmers  that  were  in production  scale fixed (constant return to scale).   The production  process tomato farming of both farmer group members and nonmembers farmer groups were not yet efficient.\r\n\r\nKey Words: efficiency, profits, tomatoes",

The data was analyzed by descriptive qualitative using PAM (Policy Analysis Matrix) analysis model and elasticity.  The result showed that private profit of autonomous pattern was Rp2,582,549 and social profit was Rp2,740,642 per 1,000 birds. Private profit of partnership pattern with contract agreement was Rp707,381 and social profit was Rp3,898.950.  Private profit of partnership pattern with verbal agreement was Rp845,200 and social profit was Rp1,491,519.  Based on the analysis competitiveness, it showed that broiler chicken farm in South Lampung Regency had competitive and comparative advantages, in which PCR and DRCR value 0.38; 0,37 (autonomous pattern), 0.75; 0,35 (contract agreement pattern) and 0.69;0,56 (verbal agreement pattern). Elasticity value showed that competitiveness of broiler chicken farming in South Lampung Regency was sensitive with the price of broiler chicken and also price of broiler feed.\r\n\r\nKey words: Broiler chicken, competitiveness, PAM (Policy Analysis Matrix)",

The study showed that there was significant difference on average production of cassava based on agroindustry between normal and El Nino seasons. There was also significant different on average income of cassava based on agroindustry between normal and El Nino seasons. There was significant difference on average total cost of cassava based on agroindustry between normal and El Nino seasons and there was significant difference on input and output prices of cassava based on agroindustry between normal and El Nino season.\r\n\r\nKey words: agroindustry, cassava, El Nino, impact",
