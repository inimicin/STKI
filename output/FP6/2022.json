      "abstract": "Tidal swamp rice farming has a big risk of crop failure. The government's efforts to help farmers to minimize losses against these risks by facilitating the AUTP program. However, there are still farmers who are reluctant to join the program. This study aims to analyze the risk and level of farmer satisfaction with the AUTP program in tidal swamp land. Research respondents were rice farmers participating in AUTP, totaling 100 farmers selected at simple random. The research was conducted in Mesuji Regency, which was determined purposively. The data analysis methods used were qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. The results showed that the risk of farmers in tidal swamp rice farming had a high level of production risk because the coefficient of variance (CV) was more than 0.5 and the lower limit of production that farmers might receive was 2,797.56 kg\/ha. in Mesuji Regency to the risk of rice farming, namely being neutral. Overall, the level of satisfaction of farmers with the AUTP program is included in the satisfied category.",
