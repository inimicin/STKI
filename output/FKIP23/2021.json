      "abstract": "Abstract\r\nThis study aims to determine the effect of origami activities on the fine motor skills of \r\nchildren aged 4-5 years. This research is using an experimental design. This research was \r\nconducted in the CABI Tanggamus learning group, which was conducted on fifteen children \r\nusing a one-group pre-test post-test design. Data collection techniques used in this study are \r\nobservation and documentation. In this study, the pre-test results of children's motor skills \r\nwere included in the Starting to Develop (MB) category, meaning the child obtained an \r\naverage score of 26 from a maximum score of 72. After the treatment, fine motor skills were \r\nincluded in Developing as Expected (BSH). The results obtained after treatment showed a \r\nscore of 58 from a maximum score of 72. The results of this study can be concluded that \r\norigami play activities can affect the fine motor skills of early childhood, which means that \r\norigami games provide changes in children's fine motor development. Based on the results of \r\nthe study, the researcher recommends origami games to improve fine motor skills.\r\nKeywords: Fine Motor Skill, Origami, Early Childhood",

However, due to a lack of early \r\nchildhood education, youths in Indonesia also have less \r\ninnovativeness and competency. This study aims to \r\ndiscover an ethical culture that enhances early childhood \r\neducation by using the concept of local wisdom. This \r\nresearch was conducted in one of the Indigenous \r\ncommunities in Indonesia which were the Sundanese \r\nCommunity in Cireundeu, West Java. The qualitative \r\napproach used the descriptive method and revealed the \r\nconsciousness of the Indigenous people in Cireundeu to \r\nengage in traditional Sundanese cultural practices by \r\npreparing their children to become ethical human beings, \r\nas well as being productive and informed global citizens. \r\nThe results show that the community has implemented \r\ndecent early childhood education, which is designed to \r\nprepare youths who actively engage as global citizens. The \r\nimplementation of this study can be applied not only to \r\nchildren in Cireundeu but also to children all over the \r\nworld. \r\nKeywords Early Childhood Education, Global",

Berdasarkan pengamatan di TK Cahaya Pelangi\r\npada bulan Agustus 2019 bahwa dari 17 anak yaitu 16 anak memiliki kemampuan\r\nmotorik halus kategori rendah dan 1 anak kategori sedang. Hal ini terlihat dalam belum\r\nmampunya anak dalam mengambil benda kecil menggunakan jempol dan jari telunjuk,\r\nmenggunting, melipat, merobek, menekuk jari untuk mengoles lem, merekatkan,\r\nmelepaskan, menjepit bahan dengan jari, menempel, merangkai\/menyusun bahan pada\r\npola gambar atau desain dengan rapi, fokus mengerjakan dari awal hingga akhir, dan\r\nmenyelesaikan hasil karya dengan tepat. Pengumpulkan data melalui observasi dan\r\ndokumentasi untuk memperkuat data tentang pengaruh kolase terhadap kemampuan\r\nmotorik halus anak. Dari analisis data diketahui adanya peningkatan kemampuan\r\nmotorik halus anak yang dapat dilihat dari observasi pretest yang memperoleh angka\r\nrata-rata 17,94% masuk kategori Kurang Mampu (KM) dan posttest yang memperoleh\r\nangka rata-rata 38,23% masuk kategori Mampu (M). Hasil penelitian menunjukkan\r\nbahwa terdapat adanya pengaruh kolase terhadap kemampuan motorik halus anak.",

Banyak cara yang dilakukan \r\npemerintah untuk melawan pandemi Covid-19. Hal ini berdampak pada aktivitas belajar mengajar. \r\nSejak Maret 2020 banyak sekolah lebih memilih menggunakan pembelajaran daring sebagai solusi \r\ndari masalah yang sedang kita hadapi bersama. Begitu pun pada TK dan lembaga sejenis. \r\nPembelajaran dalam TK lebih banyak menekankan pada pertemuan secara langsung untuk \r\nmenstimulasi aspek perkembangan anak, seperti aspek perkembangan sosial yang menekankan \r\nanak untuk berinteraksi dengan teman sebaya, guru, tenaga pendidik, atau orang dewasa \r\nsekitarnya. Namun, karena pembelajaran secara langsung diubah menjadi daring akankah aspek \r\nperkembangan sosial anak akan terpengaruh? Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui pengaruh \r\npembelajaran daring terhadap aspek perkembangan sosial anak usia 5-6 tahun. Penelitian ini \r\ndilakukan dengan menggunakan metode deskriptif kualitatif. Penelitian ini dilaksanakan pada \r\ntanggal 15-22 Desember di TK Handayani. \r\nKata Kunci: Perkembangan Sosial; Pembelajaran Daring,;Covid-19",

      "abstract": "Elementary school students in low grades are classified as early childhood with strong sensitivity during their \r\ndevelopment. This period expects parents to optimize guidance and provide appropriate direction for children's learning activities. Based on mathematics importance in life, the subject’s skills need to be developed from an early stage through proper guidance. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, all learning activities are carried out from home, therefore parents have a bigger role in guiding the children. Parental guidance implementation is important for maximum learning achievement and success. Therefore, this research’s objectives were to (1) provide an overview of mathematics learning guidance implementation in the low grades during the pandemic, and (2) knowing parents’ needs, constraints and obstacles in carrying out the learning process. The method used was descriptive analysis with quantitative and qualitative approaches. The data were obtained through questionnaires, documentation and interviews. Also, the results showed that parental guidance in mathematics learning during the pandemic had not been implemented properly. Parents also experienced various obstacles in guiding the children.",

The instrument used in this research was \r\nthe observation sheet in the form of an assessment rubric type rating scale. The \r\ndata analysis was done by using descriptive analysis and simple linear regression. \r\nThe results show that there were a significant difference in scores between before \r\nand after the treatment using the scientific approach-based learning process and a \r\nsignificant effect of this approach on problem solving skills of early childhood.\r\nKeywords: scientific approach, learning, problem solving skills, early childhood, skill",

      "abstract": "Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengembangkan dongeng sains dalam meningkatkan scientific attitude anak usia 5-7 tahun. Dongeng berisi muatan dan aktivitas-aktivitas sains yang terintegrasi dalam alur cerita. Scientific attitude yang berarti sikap ilmiah perlu ditanamkan sejak masa usia dini. Tentunya hal ini dapat disisipkan melalui sebuah cerita\r\nyang dapat didongengkan kepada anak. Scientific attitude merupakanmsikap atau tingkah laku seseorang yang menjadi kebiasaan untuk menanggapi suatu peristiwa alam dengan cara\r\nmencari tahu dan memecahkan masalah menggunakan metode ilmiah. Sikap yang perlu untuk ditingkatkan pada anak usia dini diantaranya adalah rasa ingin tahu (curiosity) dan\r\nberpikir kritis. Rasa ingin tahu dan memiliki pemikiran kritis yang dimiliki sejak anak usia dini dapat menjadi tumpuan dalam memperoleh pembelajaran ditingkat yang lebih tinggi. Penelitian yang diusulkan ini merupakan penelitian research and development (RND) atau penelitian pengembangan yang mengadaptasi model Borg & Gall. Langkah pengembangannya meliputi; 1) astudi pendahuluan; 2) perencanaan; 3) pengembangan draft awal produk; 4) uji coba terbatas; 5) revisi produkauji coba terbatas; 6) uji coba diperluas; 7)\r\nrevisi produk uji coba diperluas; 8) ujiaoperasional; 9) revisi produk akhir; dan 10) diseminasi dan implementasi. Subjek penelitian adalah siswa SD yang berada di wilayah\r\nKota Bandar Lampung. Diharapkan pada tahap pertama dalam penelitian ini akan menghasilkanadraf atau prototype dongeng sains melalui need analysis, validasi dan revisi draf uji coba terbatas. Tahap kedua akan menghasilkan dongeng sains yang valid dan efektif untuk meningkatkan scientific attitude anak usia 5-7 tahun. Tahapaketiga akan menghasilkan\r\nproduk final dongeng sains dan dapat didiseminasikan kepada orang tua yang memiliki anak usia 5-7 tahun yang berada di wilayah Kota Bandar Lampung.",
