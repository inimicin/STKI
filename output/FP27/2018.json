      "abstract": "Worm disease is a disease caused by infestation of worms in the body of animals with minimal risk to cause death, but causes losses in the form of decreased body weight, milk production, body resistance to other diseases and stunted growth, especially goats at a young age. Population of goats in Lampung Province is the third largest position in Indonesia that it is important to know the effects that can be caused due to intestinal worms. The purpose of this study was to determine the ratio of goat body weight infestated by various types of intestinal worms so that the researchers knew the impact of digestive tract worms infestation on goat body weight. The study was conducted in the period July - October 2018 in the Budi Lestari Livestock Group, Gedong Tataan, Pesawaran Regency, Lampung Province. The type of goat used in the study was the Etawa Breeders Goat. The method is a completely randomized design (CRD) with five treatments, namely the group of uninfested goats (P1); goat infested with 1 type of worm (P2); goat infested with 2 types of worms (P3); goats infected with 3 types of worms (P4); and goats infected with 4 types of worms (P5). Implementation procedures were (1) conducting a survey of PE goat populations; (2) Determining the age of PE goats; (3) Taking feces; (4) Identifying worm eggs (Mc Master Test and Sedimentation Test); (5) Determine samples; (6) Considering body weights; (7) Data tabulation and analysis. Data analysis was carried out using One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method at a 95% confidence level with SPSS 24 software program, if there were significant differences then proceed with the Least Significant Differences (LSD) and Duncan Test. The results of the data analysis showed that there were no significant differences between treatments (p> 0.05), but based on the average data of PE goats body weight from various treatments the highest in the treatment group that did not infest worm infestation (P1) was 25.25 kg, continued to decline respectively P2 (19.00 kg), P3 (18.25 kg), P4 (16.00 kg), P5 (15.25 kg). The conclusion of the study is the more types of worm infestations in the body, the lower of PE goats body weight.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Body Weight, Etawa Breed Goat, Infestation, Intestinal Worms, Types of Worm",

Optimizing the utilization of palm oil waste\r\nfor ruminant feed can be accomplished through feed processing, such as fermentation. The objectives of this research were to determine\r\n) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs)] and\r\nfeed digestibility [total digestible nutrients (TDN)] and digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, protein and crude fibre, in Ongole cattle.\r\nMethodology: This study utilized a random block design and was based on weight gain. The design included 3 treatments and 3\r\nthe best effect of a fermented palm by-product-based ration on rumen parameters [ammonia (NH\r\n3\r\nreplicates; thus, nine cattle were included. The treatments tested in this research were a control ration (R0; rice straw, cassava waste,\r\ncoconut meal, rice bran, molasses, urea and premix), non-fermented palm oil by-product-based ration (R1; cassava waste, rice bran,\r\nmolasses, urea and premix+palm leaves and palm kernel meal) and fermented palm oil by-product-based ration (R2; cassava waste, rice\r\nbran, molasses, urea and premix+palm leaves and palm kernel meal). Results: Rumen liquid VFA and NH\r\nconcentrations were highest\r\nat 110 and 6.74 mM, respectively, after treatment with non-fermented palm oil waste. Feed digestibility parameters (TDN and digestibility\r\n3 \r\nof dry material and organic material) were highest after treatment with fermented palm oil waste, with values of 82.94, 69.75 and 75.69%,\r\nrespectively. The highest digestibility of protein was obtained with the control ration. Conclusion: Palm oil waste-based rations\r\n, rumen liquid VFA, the digestibility of dry and organic material and TDN.

Disease in livestock caused by liver worm infections are called Fasciolosis. Fasciolosis is an important parasitic disease because it can cause high economic losses. The research method was the census method. Data retrieval were 125 dairy cattle faecal samples from people's dairy farms in Lampung Province. The datas obtained were analyzed descriptively. Examination of faecal samples was carried out at the Lampung Veterinary Center using the Sedimentation Test. The results showed the prevalence of liver worms in dairy cattle in Lampung Province was 12.00%, 15 dairy cattle those were positively infested by liver worms. The highest dairy cattle prevalence in West Lampung Regency at 33.33%, while the lowest prevalence is in dairy cattle in Bandar Lampung City and Tanggamus Regency at 0%.\r\n\r\nKeywords:  Dairy Cattle Livestock, Lampung Province, Liver Worms, Prevalence, Sedimentation Test",

This research has been done on March—June 2018 in Tanjung Agung Area, Katibung District, Kalianda, South Lampung. This research used Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with split plot design method. The treatment was implemented in this research is (1) shading, consist of two levels, which are N0 (without shade) and N1 (palm oil tree shade) and (2) mixed plant species, consist of two variations; which is A1 (elephant grass and purple bush bean) and A2 (dwarf elephant grass and purple bush bean). The data which obtained were analyzed by analysis of variance on 5% significant level, then if the result significantly difference, it were analyzed with Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT). The results showed that palm oil shading has not significant effect on grass productivity. there is an interaction between the type of grass and oil palm shade on the number of elephant grass and odot grass tillers. The dry matter of grass on mixed planting on land without shade was significantly different with dry matter of grass on mixed planting in palm oil shade. However, it has tendency to increase organic matter of grasss on palm oil shade.",
