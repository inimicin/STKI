      "abstract": "This study was going to find out the significant difference of the English communicative competence between the students who were taught by using original PPP method and the students who were taught by using modified PPP by using CLT. Moreover, the more effective method between original PPP method and the modified one in improving the students’ communicative competence was investigated. This is a quasi-experimental research using both control and experimental class comparing the original and modified PPP. The subject was forty junior EFL students whose English were still at the lower level. The result showed that there is a significant difference between students’ English communicative competence after being taught by using original PPP method and the modified one. In addition, both original and modified PPP are good to facilitate the learners in having good grammatical competence; however, only PPP that has been modified by using CLT that can facilitate them in having a good communicative competence.",

This study applied the descriptive quantitative design; the subjects were 13 female Thai students taking a bachelor’s degree in Indonesia; and the instrument used was a variant of SILL. It was found that overall they used different strategies in learning the two languages in different contexts. The result also shows that there are significantly differences in language strategies used by the Thai students in learning English and Indonesian especially in Cognitive strategy and Social strategy when they learn in Indonesia. The results are discussed in light of the previous research findings in relevance to those of this study",

A quantitative study in the form of pre-experimental design was conducted which involved 24 students of English study program in the Faculty of Education at Lampung University-Indonesia who took Pre-Intermediate writing class. These students were prepared to be junior and\/or senior school English teachers. Therefore, language accuracy was badly needed. The results demonstrate that there was improvement of students‟ writing language accuracy after the implementation of integrating Think-Pair-Share and teacher‟s corrective feedback within discovery learning strategy. Grammar accuracy was the highest compared to vocabulary and spelling accuracy. In addition, the students demonstrated positive perception among the five categories of perception, interest and motivation were the highest. It is because of the steps of TPS and minimum TCF in the form of scaffolding and constructive questions of the teacher.",

The population was the students of SMKN 1 Metro. This study is quasi-experimental, and the sampling\r\nwas taken in two classes. The experimental class was given the treatment using a modified PPP procedure through WhatsApp. In contrast, the control class was given the treatment using the original PPP procedure in limited offline learning. The findings showed a significant difference in students' achievement of conditional sentences between those two procedures, which is in line with the difference in students' perception of the learning process between those two classes. Modified one was more effective in improving students' achievement of conditional sentences, especially in pandemic Covid 19, where online learning is necessary. The conclusion is that the modification of the PPP procedure through WhatsApp is very effective to use even after the pandemic, because there are more opportunities for students to discuss using WhatsApp which makes them gain a deeper understanding and better achievement of the conditional sentence material.",

The findings indicate all of the studies under review were conducted through a qualitative\r\napproach with the instruments of observations, interviews, and questionnaire. Teachers and students have the benefit of translanguaging practices in EFL classrooms, yet it should be\r\ntaken into account that L1 should be adopted judiciously. They translanguage using English, Indonesian, and local languages and even foreign languages other than English. They have voiced their agreement to the implementation of translanguaging as pedagogy since it positively impacts EFL teaching and learning. However, few teachers have contrasting views about this voice. Suggestions for future research on translanguaging are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "In recent decades, translanguaging has made rapid progress in the field of language instruction. The term \"translanguaging\" implies that bilinguals have a single linguistic repertoire from which they strategically select linguistic features for effective communication. The current method of language education, which takes a monolingual approach, faces a challenge from the phenomenon known as translanguaging. Therefore, this study aims to describe the perspectives of Indonesian EFL teachers on translanguaging-based EFL instruction for students from a variety of linguistic backgrounds. This is a qualitative study employing interviews to collect data, with eight EFL teachers serving as participants. A content analysis was used to analyze the collected data. This study suggests that EFL teachers have divergent perspectives on translanguaging in EFL classrooms. However, those with negative attitudes toward translanguaging recognize the importance of this pedagogical approach and continue to use L1 in their EFL classrooms, indicating that they still believe in monolingual pedagogy even though they do not fully apply it. Finally, the study's implications and limitations are discussed.",

This study is quasi-experimental, and the sampling \r\nwas taken in two classes. The experimental class was given the treatment using a modified PPP \r\nprocedure through WhatsApp. In contrast, the control class was given the treatment using the original \r\nPPP procedure in limited offline learning. The findings showed a significant difference in students' \r\nachievement of conditional sentences between those two procedures, which is in line with the difference \r\nin students' perception of the learning process between those two classes. Modified one was more \r\neffective in improving students' achievement of conditional sentences, especially in pandemic Covid 19, \r\nwhere online learning is necessary. The conclusion is that the modification of the PPP procedure \r\nthrough WhatsApp is very effective to use even after the pandemic, because there are more opportunities \r\nfor students to discuss using WhatsApp which makes them gain a deeper understanding and better \r\nachievement of the conditional sentence material. \r\nKeywords: PPP Procedure, WhatsApp, Limited Offline Learning, Students' Achievement of Conditional \r\nSentence, Students' Perception",

      "abstract": "It is widely known that the English language has rapidly spread across the globe and is now used for a wide range of purposes. Its status as a national\/foreign language has shifted to that of an international language. Despite this awareness, however, studies on perceptions of English as an international language (EIL) among EFL preservice teachers in the Indonesian context are not commonplace in the literature. Therefore, this study was aimed at elucidating the perceptions of the four aspects of EIL among EFL preservice teachers in higher education institutions in Indonesia. This quantitative study adopted a descriptive approach using a five-point Likert scale questionnaire with a total of 14 close-ended statements. Data collected from the questionnaire were analysed using descriptive statistics. The findings suggest that EIL is positively viewed by participants as a means of global communication to achieve a variety of purposes. They welcome and accept various varieties of English, demonstrating a strong multilingual\/multicultural understanding through their ability to accept different pronunciation patterns and adapt their behavior and conversational styles when interacting with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. They have a strong sense of ownership over their own English varieties. Finally, the study’s implications for the four aspects of EIL including the current status of English, English varieties, multicultural communication strategies, and the identity of English speakers are also discussed, along with limitations and recommendations for future research.",

      "abstract": "It is widely known that the English language has rapidly spread across the globe and is now used for a wide range of purposes. Its status as a national\/foreign language has shifted to that of an international language. Despite this awareness, however, studies on perceptions of English as an international language (EIL) among EFL preservice teachers in the Indonesian context are not commonplace in the literature. Therefore, this study was aimed at elucidating the perceptions of the four aspects of EIL among\r\nEFL preservice teachers in higher education institutions in Indonesia. This quantitative study adopted a descriptive approach using a five-point Likert scale questionnaire with a total of 14 close-ended statements. Data collected from the questionnaire were analysed using descriptive statistics. The findings suggest that EIL is positively viewed by participants as a means of global communication to achieve a variety of purposes. They welcome and accept various varieties of English, demonstrating a strong\r\nmultilingual\/multicultural understanding through their ability to accept different pronunciation patterns and adapt their behavior and conversational styles when interacting with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. They have a strong sense of ownership over their own English varieties. Finally, the study’s implications for the four aspects of EIL including the current status of English, English varieties, multicultural communication strategies, and the identity of English speakers are also discussed, along with limitations and recommendations for future research.",

      "abstract": "The use of online interactive media in English teaching and learning has been significantly increasing since past few years. The media got more popular after distant or online learning was encouraged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergence of digital learning management systems such as Edmodo, Google Classroom, and Moddle further intensified the implementation of not only education-based platforms such as British Council and Quizziz, but also popularized non-education media such as YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter which were intentionally designed for entertainment. This research is designed to foster students’ perceptions on the use of online digital interactive media and correlate the perceptions with their reading comprehension ability. A total of 41 students from different middle and high schools, who lived in various orphanages, participated in this research. Close-ended Likert-scale questionnaire was distributed to obtain the data of students’ perceptions while reading comprehension test was adapted from British Council and implemented to see the correlation between the students’ perception and their reading comprehension ability. The finding shows that more than 75% of the students believed that online digital interactive media were very crucial and helpful in language learning process. Moreover, the mean score of the reading comprehension test indicated positive correlation between students’ perceptions and their reading comprehension ability. This study implies foster students’ perceptions in the use of online interactive media highly correlate with their reading comprehension performance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\r\nThis study describes the reading French using a problem-based learning model, which is compared to reading French in conventionally. Reading in problem-based class has a positive impact on students' reading scores,and the growth of their self-awareness to work together and be responsible for solving the problems given. This study used an \r\nexperimental method with a population of all semester 1 students of the French Language Education Study Program for the Academic Year 2019\/2020, and the sample was carried out using a lottery technique for the experimental and the control class. The results of the study have proven that the reading ability of students in problem-based learning is \r\nhigher than those using the conventional method, and the level of students' reading ability is in the good category with a median of 75, and the results of the study represent the population, so the hypothesis is accepted.\r\nKeywords : problem-based learning, French reading skill.\r\nAbstrak\r\nPenelitian ini menggambarkan proses belajar membaca bahasa Prancis dengan menggunakan model belajar berbasis masalah, yang dibandingkan dengan belajar membaca secara konvensional.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT\r\n \r\nAs part of speaking skill, pronunciation has an important factor in learning English as a\r\nforeign language, especially in communication. In English communication, if our\r\npronunciation is wrong or inappropriate the result will be miscommunication, even to the\r\npoint of not conveying the purpose of communication in a conversation because the\r\nmeaning of a word or sentence is not conveyed properly. So far, the steps for learning and\r\nmodeling pronunciation in English are done directly or face-to-face. Lecturers and\r\nstudents also need appropriate learning media and support online learning to carry out this\r\nPronunciation course. Regarding applications, the benefits of many applications that are\r\nsuitable for learning English are; students can watch videos related to the topic, are able\r\nto save examples of learning materials, and are able to save the exercises they have done\r\nas learning evaluation material for teachers and students later. Applications which are\r\nappropriate are the methods which are not only support online learning but can also\r\nimprove students' pronunciation skills. This study aims to determine whether or not using\r\nthe pronunciation application have an significant effect on students' pronunciation\r\nabilities. This study is used one group pretest-posttest. This design analyzes the results of\r\nstudents' pronunciation abilities at the beginning and at the end of the lesson. The subjects\r\nof this study were undergraduate students of the English Education Study Program, FKIP\r\nUniversity of Lampung. One class consists of 31 students who take pronunciation\r\ncourses. Based on the data analysis, the researcher concludes that there is no significant\r\ndifference of students’ pronunciation ability before and after taught using pronunciation\r\napplications. Meanwhile, we can say that there is slightly significant improvement\r\nbetween pretest of posttest of pronunciation test. \r\nKeywords: Application, Pronunciation, Pronunciation Abilities",

      "abstract": "More studies advocate explicit strategy training and a few studies agree that training strategies should be integrated in language learning. The present study reports on the implementation of an implicit strategy training for metacognitive strategies in the context of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) setting in Indonesia. In the study which involved 37 senior high school students, strategies were measured using a questionnaire based on a seven - point Likert scale comprising of metacognitive strategies for the four language skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing. To find out the effect of implicit learning strategy training on students’ learning strategy use, a paired sample t-test was used to compare the data taken from the students’ learning strategy questionnaire. An English proficiency test was also administered for the purpose of the identification of the students’ proficiency in English before and after the treatment, and to correlate them with the use of metacognitive strategies. The findings indicate that there was a trend towards students using metacognitive strategies of the four language skills more frequently after they were trained to use such strategies implicitly. In particular, the study reveals that the language learners significantly improved their use of metacognitive strategies in writing, and the use of metacognitive strategies in writing was significantly correlated to students’ writing performance. The study suggests that language learners could improve their language performance through the improvement of strategy use in implicit strategy training.",

Methodology:  It  was  conducted  in  Muhammadiyah Vocational  school  Bandar  Lampung.  The  sample  comprises  30  students  using random  sampling  technique.  A  questionnaire  was  used  to  trace  students’ cognitivelearning strategy, and two sets of tests were used to measure students’ vocabulary   mastery   and   another   to   measure   their   reading   ability.   The instruments were tried out to determine the quality of validity, reliability, level of difficulty and discriminating power. The findings: It has been found that, first, there    is    a    correlation    between    vocabulary    mastery    (X1)    and    reading comprehension  (Y),  where  rx1.y  =  0.35;  second,  there  is  a  correlation  between students’ cognitive learning style (X2) and their reading ability (Y). where rx2.y= 0.95,  it  is  very  strong  correlation:  and  finally,  there  is  a  composite  correlation between X1, X2, and their reading ability (Y). Multiple regression is 0.997 meaning that  there  is  a  positive  and  significant  correlation  between  X1,  X2,  and  Y.  It suggests  that  to  improve  reading  ability,  teachers  should  develop  students’ vocabulary  mastery  and  cognitive  learning  style.  Cognitive  learning  style  and vocabulary mastery cannot be separated.",

      "abstract": "he aims of the study are to find out whether there is a significant difference in students' achievement of conditional sentences between those who are taught using modified PPP procedure through WhatsApp and those who are taught using original PPP procedure in limited offline learning. The population was the students of SMKN 1 Metro. This study is quasi-experimental, and the sampling was taken in two classes. The experimental class was given the treatment using a modified PPP procedure through WhatsApp. In contrast, the control class was given the treatment using the original PPP procedure in limited offline learning. The findings showed a significant difference in students' achievement of conditional sentences between those two procedures, which is in line with the difference in students' perception of the learning process between those two classes. Modified one was more effective in improving students' achievement of conditional sentences, especially in pandemic Covid 19, where online learning is necessary. The conclusion is that the modification of the PPP procedure through WhatsApp is very effective to use even after the pandemic, because there are more opportunities for students to discuss using WhatsApp which makes them gain a deeper understanding and better achievement of the conditional sentence material.",
