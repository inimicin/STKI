The study subjects were taken as many as 42 students consisting of 9\r\nlimited test students in small groups, 15 students were limited to large groups and 18 students were field tested.\r\nData collection techniques in the form of questionnaires, interviews and tests. Furthermore, it was analyzed\r\nusing tests of effectiveness, efficiency and attractiveness. The results of the effectiveness data analysis showed\r\nthat N-Gain in the field test was effective because of 0.78≥0.70. Thus based on the calculation of the average NGain normalized to 0.78% with high qualifications so that the use of the Project Based Learning model to build\r\nstudents' obedience towards traffic regulations proved effective. The results of the efficiency data analysis with\r\nthe calculation obtained the value of ratio 1 with high classification, so that the use of project based learning\r\nmodel to build students' obedience towards traffic regulations proved efficiency because 1> 0.5. The results of\r\nthe data analysis are interesting that the use of project based learning model for students' obedience to traffic\r\nrules has proven attractive because it obtained a percentage of 83.3% with an interesting classification."

The results of the efficiency data analysis with the calculation obtained the value of ratio 1 with high classification, so that the use of project based learning model to build students' obedience towards traffic regulations proved efficiency because 1> 0.5.

Thus based on the calculation of the average NGain normalized to 0.78% with high qualifications so that the use of the Project Based Learning model to build students' obedience towards traffic regulations proved effective. The results of the efficiency data analysis with the calculation obtained the value of ratio 1 with high classification, so that the use of project based learning model to build students' obedience towards traffic regulations proved efficiency because 1> 0.5. The results of the data analysis are interesting that the use of project based learning model for students' obedience to traffic\r\nrules has proven attractive because it obtained a percentage of 83.3% with an interesting classification.",

The purpose of this study is to analyze the factors that influence the work readiness of vocational education graduates.The study used a descriptive correlation method. A sample of 20 students was determined by random sampling technique.Data was collected by a closed questionnaire\r\ninstrument with a Likert scale.The work readiness indicator includes four aspects, with the collaboration aspect value (0.82), being critical (0.78), accepting responsibility (0.81), ambition to progress (0.79) and adjusting (0.77 ) Data were analyzed by correlation.The work readiness of vocational education graduates is more influenced by aspects of being critical and collaborating. Thus the aspect of being critical with 0.878 coefficients and collaborating 0.74, thus proven aspects that are able to form work readiness for vocational\r\neducation graduates, not aspects of accepting responsibility, ambition to move forward and adjust.",

Ketiga aspek kompetensi tersebut dirinci dalam sub-sub aspek kompetensi sebagai berikut, a) memetakan dan membuat jaringan kompetensi dasar dan indikator pembelajaran dari berbagai bidang studi, b) merancang rencana pembelajaran berbasis tema, b) melaksanakan pembelajaran berbasis tema, dan c) mengembangkan perangkat pembelajaran sesuai dengan tema yang dirancang. 2) Membangun kerjasama FKIP dengan SD di propinsi Lampung. Target khusus yang ingin dicapai adalah meningkatkan kompetensi guru pada 1) memetakan dan membuat jaringan kompetensi dasar dan indikator pembelajaran dari berbagai bidang studi, 2) merancang rencana pembelajaran berbasis tema, 3) melaksanakan pembelajaran berbasis tema,  dan 4) mengembangkan perangkat pembelajaran sesuai dengan tema yang dirancang. Untuk mencapai target khusus pengabdian dilakukan kegiatan pengabdian dengan metode siklus pengabdian. Kegiatan pengabdian dengan siklus pengabdian terdiri dari 1) menyusun rencana kegiatan, 2) melakukan tindakan pengabdian guna mencapai target pengabdian, 3) observasi terhadap tindakan yang dilakukan dan 4) refleksi terhadap tindakan yang dilakukan guna perbaikan tindakan siklus pengabdian berikutnya. Tindakan pengabdian dilakukan dengan kegiatan 1) penyajian materi, 2) penyajian contoh dan 3) bimbingan.  Siklus pengabdian direncanakan dilakukan sebanyak 2 siklus.

The method used in this study is the Research and Development (R & D) approach. The results of the study were obtained from the first level of reading and writing teaching media, level 2 and level 3.  The results of learning media have undergone various validation tests and shown learning effectiveness. Content validation test results obtained mean rating 4.18, which means the media content is very valid. Language validation test results obtained 4.24 which means that the language of learning media is very good. Design validation results obtained 4.34, which means the teaching media design is very good. The effectiveness data shown that preliminary reading and writing teaching media has mean of 40.75 at 3≤ R˂4, which means that the preliminary reading and writing teaching media categorized as very effective in facilitating students to learn  how to read and how to write at the beginning.",
