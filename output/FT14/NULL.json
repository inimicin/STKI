The weight gain kinetics of the steel with mixtures of salt deposits display a rapid growth rates, compared with the weight gain kinetics of AISI 1020 steel without salt deposit in dry air oxidation, and follow a steady-state parabolic law for 49 h. Chloridation and sulfidation produced by a molten NaCl\/Na2SO4 on the steel induced hot-corrosion mechanism attack, and are responsible for the formation of thicker scale. The most severe corrosion takes place with the 70 wt.% NaCl mixtures in Na2SO4. The typical Fe2O3 whisker growth in outer part scale was attributed to the FeCl3 volatilization. The formation of FeS in the innermost scale is more pronounced as the content of Na2SO4 in the mixture is increased.",
