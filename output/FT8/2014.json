      "abstract": "Abstract– A service-level agreement (SLA) defined contract of\r\nservice between Service Provider and Customer. Usually this\r\ndocument contain technical values. Customer needs monitor its\r\nservices to ensure the service comply with SLA. Nowadays, energy\r\nefficiency is one of most significant issue. How to provide low cost\r\nand low power for electricity, temperature, network utilization\r\nmonitoring was carried out in this paper. Raspberry Pi BCM2835\r\nas a mini computer was used to  ran the services monitoring.\r\nTestbed has been deployed in University of Lampung (Unila) data\r\ncentre.  The systems was built base on modified waterfall software\r\nengineering principles. The result presented that the system was\r\nrunning properly and provided data statistics of electricity,\r\ntemperature, and network utilization through an interactive\r\nwebsite  interface that generated by python script. Any peculiar\r\ncondition informed immediately to network administrator via sms\r\nor email for properly treatment.  During testbed throughout a\r\nmonth on June 2014, peak time for daily bandwidth utilization\r\noccurred at working hours, starting from 8 am to 4 pm.\r\nMaximum temperature recorded was 38\r\n0\r\nC and minimum was\r\n15\r\n0\r\nC. For a month there were accumulated total 15.456 hours for\r\nelectricity black out. The usage of cpu resource show less than\r\n20%, and memory usage average on 58%.  All data from this\r\napplication was used by top IT management, to evaluated\r\nelectricity and internet service SLA. \r\n\r\nKeywords: python programming, green computing, electricity\r\nmonitoring, temperature monitoring, network monitoring",

      "abstract": "The development of telecommunication technology specified the Internet Protocol (IP) based technology for the next generation network. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) has been introduced to overcome future telephony demand. However, these rapid changes encountered some issues, and the most critical is how to provide the services availability and reliability equally to circuit based telephony. Virtualization is widely used not only for hardware efficiency and maintenance, but also for High Availability support. Virtualized environment provides the ability among servers to migrate or replicate into another machine, even when they are running their services, which is known as Live Migration. In this paper, the voice quality of VoIP service when running on the High Availability system in virtualized environment is studied and examined. The objective analysis by using quality of services (QoS) attributes is conducted as well as the subjective analysis using Mean Opinion Score (MOS). The work utilizes Xen® Hypervisor with modified Remus extensions to provide the High Availability environment. Remus approach using checkpoint based is deployed to copy the primary server to the backup server. A range of 40ms – 900ms has been applied as time interval of checkpoint. The results show that the mean jitter is 9,98 ms, packet loss 3,12% and MOS 3.61 for Remus 400ms checkpoint. MOS with different checkpoint time interval is also presented.",
