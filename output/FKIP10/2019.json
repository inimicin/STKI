Methods: This study used a survey method for a number of Social Sciences Education teachers in junior high\r\nschools. Data was collected using a questionnaire regarding teacher identity and soft skill instruments as a result of development that had been expertly tested and small group tests according to the Borg and Galls design. Findings: There was a significant relationship between age and the quality of soft skills scores (r = -0.292, p < 0.05.). In line with that, a negative correlation was also obtained between age and personal attributes (r = -0.287, p < 0.05. Conclusions: Soft skills tended to decrease for\r\nteachers as they grew older, the soft skills the teachers had differed in terms of rank and class and\r\nSoft skills were closely related to teacher professional development.",
