      "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to know and analyze the influence of Parenting Patterns and SelfConcepts on Entrepreneurial Interests both partially and simultaneously. Research is included in quantitative descriptive research. The results showed there is a real influence of parenting patterns on entrepreneurial interests can be shown with the value of R square = 0.361 or 36.1 %. So, if the parenting\r\npattern is raised it will increase the interest of students by 36.1% or the contribution of parenting patterns\r\nto entrepreneurial interests by 36.1%. The influence of self-concept on students' entrepreneurial interests\r\ncan be shown by a value of R square= 0.347 or 34.7%. this means that the concept of self-concept to the entrepreneurial interests of students by 34.7% and the influence of parenting patterns and self-concepts have an influence on students' entrepreneurial interests by 36.3% and the remaining 63.7% is influenced by other factors that are not studied.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: - Many papers have been published in recent years describing prospective teachers' generic and teaching skills. However, to our best knowledge, little is known about how they acquire and apply these skills in real-life situations outside of the classroom, among communities through student community service program in particular. In other words, because empirical evidence in the literature has failed to recognise the implementation of prospective teachers’ generic skills among communities, the question on this topic remains open. Therefore, our purpose was to explore and describe prospective teachers’ generic skills when taking part\r\nin a community service program. This study is qualitative in nature, with a total of 150 students consisting of\r\n100 females (67%) and 50 males (33%) enrolled at the Faculty of Teacher Training and Education in a public\r\nuniversity in Indonesia participating by adopting a questionnaire and audio-recorded interviews for data\r\ncollection. The data collected through questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive statistics, while the\r\ninformation collected through the interviews was evaluated and interpreted using content analysis through\r\ncoding classification and theme or pattern identification, with the goal of providing thorough descriptive\r\ninterpretations of social phenomena. The findings reveal that the prospective teachers under investigation\r\nstrongly agree and agree that community service program has benefited them personally, socially, and professionally, as well as improved their generic skills. They could develop their generic skills while participating in a student community service program. The findings of this study provide clear evidence that generic skills and the development of these skills are deemed important by students enrolled at teacher training and education. Based on the findings, the implications and limitations of this present study with several suggestions for future research are also discussed.",

The method used is quantitative using the chi-square analysis technique. Data collection techniques in this study use observation techniques, questionnaires, and documentation. The research was conducted at SMPN 26 Tulang Bawang Barat. The results showed that: (1) Interest in learning with a value of X2 arithmetic > X2 table that is equal to 82.94 > 12.59 which indicates Ho is rejected, which means that children's interest in learning causes children to drop out of school. (2) Motivation to learn with a value of X2 arithmetic > X2 table that is equal to 34.12 > 12.59 which indicates Ho is rejected, which means that children's learning motivation causes children to drop out of school. (3) Parent's Economy with a value of X2 arithmetic > X2 table that is equal to 93.97 > 12.59 which shows Ho is rejected, which means that the economy of parents causes children to drop out of school. (4) Parental education with a value of X2 arithmetic > X2 table that is equal to 31.82 > 12.59 which shows Ho is rejected, which means that parental education causes children to drop out of school. (5) The school environment with a value of X2 count X2 table that is equal to 12.54 12.59 which shows Ho is accepted which means that the school environment does not cause children to drop out of school. (6) Living environment with a value of X2 count > X2 table which is 34.49 > 12.59 which indicates Ho is rejected, which means that the living environment causes children to drop out of school.",

(2) Motivation to learn with a value of X2 arithmetic > X2 table that is equal to 34.12 > 12.59 which indicates Ho is rejected, which means that children's learning motivation causes children to drop out of school. (3) Parent's Economy with a value of X2 arithmetic > X2 table that is equal to 93.97 > 12.59 which shows Ho is rejected, which means that the economy of parents causes children to drop out of school. (4) Parental education with a value of X2 arithmetic > X2 table that is equal to 31.82 > 12.59 which shows Ho is rejected, which means that parental education causes children to drop out of school. (5) The school environment with a value of X2 count X2 table that is equal to 12.54 12.59 which shows Ho is accepted which means that the school environment does not cause children to drop out of school. (6) Living environment with a value of X2 count > X2 table which is 34.49 > 12.59 which indicates Ho is rejected, which means that the living environment causes children to drop out of school.",

      "abstract": "Entrepreneurship is an important component in economics, especially for students in universities. However, it is not clear what aspects of entrepreneurship play the most significant role in student success. Therefore, this study aims to examine the effect of entrepreneurial attitudes on entrepreneurial intentions, self-efficacy on entrepreneurial intentions, and subjective norms on entrepreneurial intentions. The research model carried out is a quantitative type and is\r\na cross-sectional study. The population in this study was students of the University of Lampung\r\nin Indonesia. The sampling technique used purposive sampling with the criteria for final semester students or at least semester 6 to consider decision making after graduation. The\r\nnumber of samples in this study was 436 people. Hypothesis testing was assisted by research data analysis using SPSS version 21 software. The results showed that entrepreneurial attitudes had a significant effect on entrepreneurial intentions. In addition, subjective norms also have a\r\nsignificant effect on entrepreneurial intentions. Likewise, self-efficacy also has a significant effect on entrepreneurial intentions. The test of the three variables that affect students 'interest in entrepreneurship can be said that the subjective norm variable is the variable that most influences students' entrepreneurial interest. Study implications and suggestions for future Mresearch are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "The education system in Indonesia is experiencing new challenges due to the Covid-19 virus outbreak, which \r\nhas caused the entire learning system in educational institutions to be shifted to online (online) methods. The \r\nimplementation of online learning that is too long has an impact on students' learning motivation. Too long a time \r\nmakes students bored because almost every day they have to sit in front of devices such as smartphones, laptops, and so \r\non to access online learning. The policy of studying at home demands a high motivation from students to learn, while \r\nwhat is happening at this time is a decline in student learning motivation. In this case, the teacher is required to be able \r\nto use technology in order to continue the continuity of teaching. Online learning media in the form of \"E-Learning \r\nMedia Portal for Home Learning Kemdikbud\" is one solution in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic to increase student \r\nlearning motivation. This study aims to explain the benefits of E-Learning to increase students' learning motivation. \r\nThis study uses a quantitative phenomenological approach and uses an interactive model of Miles & Huberman. Data \r\nwere collected through in-depth interviews, observations, and questionnaires. The results showed an increase in \r\nstudents' learning motivation in social studies lessons by utilizing five features in the Learning House Portal such as: \r\nLearning resources, Electronic School Books (BSE), Question Banks, Cultural Maps, and Maya Classes (google meet \r\nand zoom meetings) as one of the Learning Resources. However, it also has obstacles from several factors such as the \r\nunpreparedness of students in the distance learning process, the conditions of the learning environment that are not \r\nconducive, the condition of the parents of students, the lack of support for facilities provided by parents, and the \r\npsychological state of students which includes: talent, intelligence, attitudes, perceptions, and interests are also factors \r\nof student success in learning.\r\nKeywords: online learning, home learning portal, learning motivation",

      "abstract": "During the Covid-19 pandemic, there were many problems that afflicted the entire community,\r\nespecially in the field of education. This happens because the learning process is carried out remotely or\r\nonline. Distance learning that is carried out affects the quality of student learning. Teachers must continue\r\nto strive to be able to understand and find out whether the subject matter taught to students has been truly\r\nunderstood or not. This must be done because teachers are required to be ready to anticipate, face\r\nchallenges, and solve problems that occur in the learning process even though online. The purpose of this\r\nstudy was to determine the learning behavior of social studies teachers during the Covid-19 pandemic.\r\nThe research method used was qualitative descriptive with Miles and Huberman data analysis techniques.\r\nData was collected through interviews, documentation, and observation. The results showed that the\r\nlearning behavior of social studies teachers at SMPN 33 Bandarlampung was not optimal in distance learning activities, because teachers were less varied in using teaching materials and learning media, so students were not very active during distance learning and students' social studies learning outcomes were not maximized. There are several efforts that can be made to improve the quality of distance learning by optimizing the asynchronous-synchronous learning model and conducting collaborative learning with\r\nteachers, students, and parents.",

Social studies education is an affective domain subject because it teaches students to see knowledge in social interactions and to apply it directly in the community environment. This study compares students' social skills acquired through moral reasoning-based cooperative learning to those acquired through simulation-based cooperative learning in order to determine the effectiveness of simulation-based and moral reasoning-based cooperative learning in improving students' social skills, as well as the interaction between the two. This research employed a quasi-experimental design with a comparative approach. The study was conducted in classes VIII A and VIII B, with 27 students and 26 students, respectively, at SMP N 27 Pesawaran, Lampung Province, Indonesia. The findings of this study indicate a significant difference in social skills between students taught using the Moral Reasoning cooperative learning model and students taught using the Simulation cooperative learning model in social studies subjects. Learning that employs the Moral Reasoning learning model is more effective than learning that employs the Simulation one.",

This research was conducted at Gedong Tataan. Gedong Tataan is an area where is located that shows the history of transmigration in Lampung during the Dutch colonial period in Indonesia. The results of this study indicate that the naming of Gedong Tataan by the Javanese is influenced by the physical aspects of the area based on the socio-cultural aspect of Java. This study concludes that all areas inhabited by Javanese transmigrants in Lampung have a toponym according to the origin of the population from Java, including the use of the Javanese language for daily communication. This behavior belongs to the realm of cultural preservation and it still thrives in migration and transmigration areas.",

      "abstract": "One of the common problems in a society that originates from multiculturalism is the emergence of a dichotomy in the community resulting in differences between ethnic groups. This distinction is often measured by domination, marginalization, majority or minority, and even stereotypes attached to each group or ethnicity. Not infrequently also formed a pattern that labels a local community and migrants. The complexity of inter-ethnic relations in multicultural societies requires controlling models for the relations with conflict potential. Actually, the concept of ethnic\r\nidentity still leaves debate that is not over, especially among experts in the social\r\nsciences. However, at least we need to get an overview of this construct. One of the strongest elements in the cultural structure of a society that can support multicultural relationships that are equilibrium and harmony is kinship because there is a mechanism in maintaining wholeness. This study aims to reveal the meaning of kinship commodification in local ethnic groups in Lampung and\r\nreveal the implicit meaning of the commodification of kinship. As a qualitative study, interviews were the main instrument for obtaining a native perspective (the giver and recipient of a title) and observing the custom ritual of awarding the title holistically and supported by several relevant documents. Collected data by rolling out information on some (original) informants to get their perspective on the culture of lifting titles for migrants who used a kinship perspective. This study also used participatory observation to get a complete picture of the\r\ncommodification of kinship in multicultural relationships. The research location included the Lampung society dominated by Papadun and Saibatin communities. The results showed that the positioning of Lampung ethnicity at the minority level\r\nin a multicultural society increased their ability to cultivate a title culture in their community structure as a tool of resistance by adopting kinship. Cultural actions\r\nwith kinship patterns and symbols make other people like relatives or family. Even the title becomes an instrument of cultural harmony in multicultural relations. The title of Lampung’s local ethnic kinship becomes the identity at stake because the title found a compromise of identity that is always modified.",

      "abstract": "Education serves the purpose of cultivating the capacity to shape character and civilisation in a dignified manner to advance the nation's intellectual life. Social studies education is an affective domain subject because it teaches students to see knowledge in social interactions and to apply it directly in the community environment. This study compares students' social skills acquired through moral reasoning-based cooperative learning to those acquired through simulation-based cooperative learning in order to determine the effectiveness of simulation-based and moral reasoning-based cooperative learning in improving students' social skills, as well as the interaction between the two. This research employed a quasi-experimental design with a comparative approach. The study was conducted in classes VIII A and VIII B, with 27 students and 26 students, respectively, at SMP N 27 Pesawaran, Lampung Province, Indonesia. The findings of this study indicate a significant difference in social skills between students taught using the Moral Reasoning cooperative learning model and students taught using the Simulation cooperative learning model in social studies subjects. Learning that employs the Moral Reasoning learning model is more effective than learning that employs the Simulation one.",

Development research is carried out to overcome the problems faced by students who find it difficult to understand the concept of supply, the law of supply and how to make a supply curve correctly. The research was conducted by Research and Development with ADDIE design which includes analysis, design, development, implementation and evaluation steps. The process of making animated video-based media has three processes, namely the preparation process, production stage, and post-production. After the animation video-based media has been produced, then the media is tested on material experts, media experts, and linguists to determine the feasibility of the product to be used. Then tested on students individually, small groups and large groups. Based on the test results of animated video-based media products, it is very suitable to be used in Social Science learning to increase students' understanding of the material offered.",

This study uses a\r\nqualitative approach. Data collection techniques using interviews, observation, and documentation. The\r\ndata analysis technique uses an interactive pattern of Miles and Huberman data. The results of this study\r\nindicate that the form of local wisdom of the Tabot culture consists of local wisdom in the form of musical\r\ninstruments used in the Tabot ceremony, traditional clothing, and the local language used as well as food\r\nand drinks. While local wisdom is intangible in the form of values contained in the Tabot ceremony,\r\nincluding the prayer of salvation which contains the meaning to always remember Allah SWT, asking for\r\nthe safety of the hereafter, and safety during the implementation of the Tabot ritual. Efforts to preserve\r\nTabot culture are influenced by several inhibiting berdoas, including the lack of support from the local government, negative perceptions of non-Tabot communities towards Tabot culture, conflicts among Tabot family members, and the values contained in each Tabot ritual are less socialized. As for the supporting berdoas in general, there is sosial support from several parties, namely support from the descendants of the Tabot family, support from the community, and support from art studios in Bengkulu",

This research method is a quantitative research with the type of experiment (Quasy Experiment Design). The population in this study were all students of class X consisting of X1 and X2 with a total of 62 students. The sample in this study was divided into two groups,\r\nnamely the experimental group of 33 students and the control group of 29 students. This study uses data collection techniques using tests, interviews, documentation. The results showed that the calculation of the t-test obtained results Tcount = 4.853 with T table = 2.035. This means that Tcount > Ttable that H1 is rejected. Based on the results of the analysis calculation, it can be concluded that there is an influence of Geographic Information System media on student learning outcomes and students who receive learning\r\nwith Geographic Information Systems media are better than before without using learning media.",
