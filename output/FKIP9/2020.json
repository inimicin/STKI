      "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic has a major impact on various sectors, one of which is education. Educators are required to design learning media as an innovation by utilizing online media. Especially for educators, they are demanded to be creative in delivering material through online learning media. This also needs to be adjusted to the level of education in its needs. This is certainly not an easy thing, because the teacher is not fully prepared. Along with the development of technology in the era of the industrial revolution 4.0, Augmented Reality (AR) provides the widest possible opportunity for the involvement of students in conducting exploration, elaboration, and creativity in an integrative manner by bridging the virtual and real world in physical phenomena. Several recent studies or even in our previous research, only reviewed how general and general teacher perceptions of AR content in the media developed, but not yet at the stage of exploring student's intention and teacher beliefs about the potential of STEM-AR if applied. We used explanatory sequential mixed method design involving 195 teachers and 183 students in Lampung Province. The results show that the level of teacher belief and expectation on the application of STEM-AR in physics learning is also in a very high category. In addition, student's intention to learn with STEM-AR is in a high category which can be described from the aspects of interest, motivation, and commitment.",

The method used in this research is Research and Development (R&D) with 3 steps namely, the initial stage, then the design and development of the product, and finally the product testing. The data analysis technique for product effectiveness is with the main field trials, namely (1) N-gain analysis, (2) paired t-test, (3) ANCOVA, and finally (4) effect size test. From the test results obtained information that conducted 10 students showed the results of the development worksheets obtained the average worth of development products by 90% this value is included in the very high category, while the student response of the average of 88% and also the readability response of 89% in the very high category. In the results of the n-gain analysis also show the value is0.70, that mean medium category. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that worksheets based on open ended can improve students' higher-order thinking skills. So, in further development we suggest that open ended-based on worksheet is not only applied to static fluid material, but also in other materials.",

The research and development (R&D) method uses the ADDIE design which consists of 5 step, namely: analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. This article will only report the first two stages namely analysis and design. The instrument used was a product needs analysis questionnaire and a practitioner validation sheet using a Likert scale. The data source of the needs analysis phase is high school students and physics teachers in Lampung Province. Product design validation was carried out by professional physics-teacher teachers with a Masters in Physics Education qualification. Where data is collected via Google Form and analyzed using descriptive qualitative. The results showed that multimeEdia to stimulate HOTS on bioenergy and wind energy was needed in the field. Multimedia which has the potential to stimulate HOTS on bioenergy and wind energy materials consists of videos and simulation of bioenergy and wind energy plants that contain all STEM.\r\n\r\nKeywords: bioenergy, multimedia, stimulating HOTS, STEM, wind energy",

This research used the static-group pretest-posttest\r\ndesign. One hundred sixty-five students from five public Senior High Schools in Lampung province, Indonesia, were\r\ntaken as samples by using random cluster sampling. Problem-solving ability data were obtained from the essay test\r\nby using a problem-solving ability survey (PSA), while data of students' self-ef icacy level toward physics subjects\r\nwere collected by using the physics self-ef icacy scale (PSES). The percentage of n-gain average determined the\r\nimprovements of self-ef icacy and problem-solving ability, dif erences between pretest and posttest, and dif erences\r\nbetween male and female students' abilities were determined by using the Wilcoxon test. The correlation between\r\nself-ef icacy and problem-solving ability was determined by using Spearman's' coef icient of correlation test. The\r\nresearch result showed that there were significant improvements in self-ef icacy and problem-solving ability in\r\nphysics problems at a significance level of 0.05. The self-ef icacy and problem-solving ability of male students were\r\nhigher than female students. There was a correlation between students' self-ef icacy and problem-solving ability in\r\nphysics.",

The development model \r\nrefers to the stage of the ADDIE model: Analyze, Design, \r\nDevelop, and Implementation. The stages of development \r\nreported in this article are only the analysis and design stages. \r\nNeeds analysis data obtained through questionnaire distribution, \r\ninterviews, and document reviews sourced from high school \r\nstudents and teachers in Lampung. Data were analyzed using \r\ndescriptive qualitative analysis. The results of this study are \r\nteachers and students need student worksheet designs that have \r\nthe potential to reduce differences in scientific reasoning and \r\nstudent argumentation performance. Student worksheet designs \r\nhave the potential to reduce differences in scientific reasoning and \r\nargumentation performance on wind and water energy materials \r\nthat are developed using the PjBl (Project Based Learning) steps\r\nand integrated of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and \r\nMathematics) to facilitate students doing problem-solving \r\nactivities, gathering information, preparing project plans, making \r\nprojects, and communicating. The results of the suitability of the \r\nactivities in the student worksheets with the STEM approach \r\nobtained an average value of 4.3 and the effectiveness of the \r\nstudent worksheets with an average score of 4.3. Based on the \r\nresults of the assessment, it shows that all components are \r\nassessed to get a score of 4.20-4.5, so the design of this student \r\nworksheet is declared very appropriate and can be used to \r\naccommodate learning styles and initial knowledge and reduce \r\ndifferences in scientific reasoning and argumentation \r\nperformance.",

      "abstract": "In the 21st century, the required human resources must be of high quality and possess high-level thinking skills, including critical, creative, innovative. Thus, the teacher's role is needed to develop these skills in preparing appropriate learning. The design of a learning plan must be able to accommodate the needs associated with the learning process in class. Activities undertaken as well as the results to be achieved through indicators of\r\nachievement must be fully reflected in the learning plans. This research was conducted to analyze teacher perceptions of STEM learning to improve understanding of diffraction\r\nconcepts. The research method used qualitative methods. Data obtained from document analysis and in-depth interviews. This study involved 75 respondents\/educators in physics who\r\nwere scattered throughout the region in Lampung Province. The results showed the tendency of teachers to still use conventional learning methods. This was identified from the learning implementation plan and student worksheets compiled by the teacher had not developed learning innovations that can train students improving the understanding of concepts. So in future research, it is necessary to develop teaching materials that are integrate with STEM, so that they can improve students conceptualization and skill.",

      "abstract": "Integrating active learning with traditional learning in the classroom can actually be done simply. However, teachers are still trying to find learning innovations so the learning \r\nprocess can be focused on each student. One of the learning models that can be used by teachers is flipped classroom. This study aims to analyze the perceptions and expectations of teachers towards the use of flipped classroom models for the learning process of physics. The research model used is a mixed-method with Sequential Explanatory Strategy. The study was conducted in high schools in the Lampung province with the subjects of the research were 60 physics teachers. Data collection used a four-point questionnaire instrument with Likert Scale and interviews. The results of the study showed that teachers had considerable expectations for the \r\nuse of flipped classroom model. The flipped classroom learning model can help teachers to convey all the physics material easily so as students can understand the material, active, interest with physics, then communication and the relationship between teachers and students will increase. The flipped classroom model will work well if it is supported by appropriate media and teaching materials. The results of this study will be a reference for the next research.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this research was to find out the practicality and effectiveness of multiple representation based teaching material to improve student’s self-efficacy and ability of physics problem solving in static electricity material. This was a quasi-experiment research by using pretest-posttest control group design. Samples were taken by using purposive sampling. Samples were grade XII students in Public Senior High School 15 (SMAN 15) in Bandar Lampung, YP UNILA Senior High School in Bandar Lampung, and Public Senior High School 2 (SMAN 2) in Kalianda. Instruments used were observation sheets for teaching material implementation, students’ response to teaching material, student’s activity sheet, self-efficacy sheet, and problems for student’s problem solving ability test. Data were analyzed by using descriptive analysis with percentage, N-gain analysis, and independent t-test. The research results showed that multiple representations based teaching material were: 1) practical to use in learning, and it was shown by (a) the average implementation of teaching materials in each \r\nlearning activity, and (b) positive student’s response in using teaching materials; 2) effective, and it was shown by (a) active category for student’s activity during learning, and (b) significant differences of self-efficacy and problem solving ability.",

Learning activities are a major part of education in schools. So in the learning process infrastructure updates are needed including multimedia learning. This research was conducted to analyze the form of multimedia as a learning resource that supports STEM learning and teacher anxiety levels in the use of multimedia in physics lessons. The research method used is a mixed method. The study was \r\nconducted in several high schools in Lampung with research subject is 90 Teachers of physics subjects. Data collection techniques used questionnaires, interviews and observations. The results showed that teachers tended to use print media and had not used multimedia. Teachers have considerable anxiety when they only teach physics using print media. Multimedia that is expected according to the perceptions of teachers is able to present the lessons in a clear, detailed, easy to use, easy to understand the language, presenting images, animations, and videos that clarify the material. So in future research, it is necessary to develop multimedia that is expected to be able to support STEM learning and student learning independence.",

The method used in the form of meta-analysis from the literature study of various journal articles in 2011-2019 with the topic of flood disaster mitigation in Indonesia includes Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, Kalimantan, taken from the international journal Disaster risk reduction, Sumatra Journal of disaster, geography and geography education Jamba: Journal of disaster risk studies, nature science, and from international seminars. The lack of articles in Indonesia that discusses public participation in English language flooding disasters such as articles from other countries, causes this research has never been done. The review results show that of the 9 articles used, it turns out that community participation in dealing with floods in several regions in Indonesia is included in the active category. Forms of participation include participation in the form of money, labor contributions, inter-community education, supervision of infrastructure development and the addition of green open space.",

This research development refers to the research design\r\nby Lee and Owens with statistics consisting of analysis, design, development, implementation,\r\nevaluation. The results obtained from this study are the validity of the assessment instruments\r\nthat have been developed very high with an average score of material expert tests 0.90,\r\nconstruct expert tests 0.94, and language expert tests 0.91, very high validity criteria, readability\r\ntest 0 , 90 with a very good category. The assessment instruments that have been developed can\r\nalready be used to assess student learning outcomes. This can be seen through the results of\r\nsmall group trials that produce a Cronbach alpha value of 0.886 which is included in the\r\ncategory of instruments with high reliability. Students respond positively to online exams\r\nthrough schoology. The conclusion of this study produced a valid assessment instrument to\r\nassess student learning outcomes with the help of schoology."

      "abstract": "The research objective was to produce assessment product for Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) using Computer \r\nBased Test (CBT) with four types of HOTS questions (true or false, multiple choices, fill in the blank and matching). It applied the basis of factual, conceptual, procedural and metacognitive-knowledge dimensions with illustrations in the form of discourse, images, graphics, videos, animation and interactive stimulation and feedback after going through the stages of logical validation, empirical validation and respondent questionnaires. Assessment product HOTS using CBT was implemented to Senior High School students in the learning process of physics subject through R&D research steps proposed by Borg and Gall that aimed to stimulate higher-order thinking skills. This is a development research in which the method was conducted by giving HOTS test questions using CBT to measure students’ HOTS profiles and distributing practical questionnaires related to students’ perceptions toward assessment\r\nproducts of HOTS using CBT. The data collection technique was carried out using expert validation sheet and\r\nrespondent questionnaire. Then, the collected data was analyzed in descriptive quantitative. The analysis showed that the logical validity obtained from expert validation on HOTS assessment using CBT was 81% with a valid category. Empirical validity was obtained from students’ HOTS test results using CBT which showed that the four types of questions were able to measure students’ HOTS. In addition, students’ responses on practical aspects were 86.75% with a very practical category. The results of the data showed that the development of assessment product of HOTS using CBT in electromagnetic induction material for Physics subject in Senior High School is already valid and practical. Thus, it was concluded that the development of HOTS assessment using CBT has already contained the right stimulus and is able to encourage students to think using HOTS. \r\n\r\nKeywords: assessment, computer based test (CBT), higher order thinking skills (HOTS), and knowledge dimensions.",

The research method was based on the ADDIE research and development (R & D) design. The research procedure used was limited product design that had been validated. Data sources at the analysis stage of smartphone utilization needs and student needs for physics learning media are 60 high school students from several provinces. The Validation of the M-learning design was carried out by lecturer who were experts in physics education and physics teacher. Data on needs analysis and m-learning design validation were collected using a questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive quantitative. The results of the questionnaire were obtained 100% of the students who were respondents had an Android smartphone and only 68.3% of students had used an Android smartphone for learning. The results of expert validation and practitioners showed that the m-learning design suitable for magnetic learning supplements was interactive, could be used for independent learning, had learning objectives content, interactive modules, broadcast material, video and animation magnetic phenomena, experimental simulations, material summaries, hyperlinks to other learning sources, as well as interactive quizzes. Learning activities including study of teaching materials, experimental simulations, assignments, quizzes, discussion forums. Synchronous learning activities were carried out for discussion forums, asynchronous for others.",

However, there are still many teachers who have not done HOTS who are able to stimulate students' high-level thinking skills well. This study discusses teacher perceptions about HOTS CBT assessment instrument models about the role of illustrations and quizzes and questions set in measuring HOTS. This type of research is a mixed method. The mixed method\r\nstrategy used is Sequential Explanatory Strategy. This research was conducted on five high school physics teachers in Metro City. Data collection using teacher perception respondents questionnaire conducted in April 2019 by five high school physics teachers in Metro City. The data collected was analyzed descriptively quantitatively. As many as 96% of teachers strongly\r\nagree that the Computer Based Test Model (CBT) involves video illustrations, animations, simulation questions, 80% of teachers agree that describing items can enrich thinking levels (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) and GPA for considered, as well as 96% of teachers strongly agree\r\nwith the form of illustration of video items, animations, complications can be removed verbalism. In addition to questions and types of questions, quizzes and question settings are considered necessary by teachers to improve higher order thinking skills (HOTS). Based on the\r\ndata obtained the validation instrument was developed to obtain the best types of questions, stimuli, as well as quizzes and question settings in improving students' higher-order thinking skills (HOTS).",

Data analysis was conducted by counting the frequency of each scale for each questionnaire item to be then converted into a percentage.

In CBT, it is recommended to display the remaining time available for working on the test. Scoring is distinguished by the cognitive level, the formation of questions, and the level of difficulty of the questions. Feedback from the system, in the form of follow-up for the students, is given both to the students who can work on the problem as a form of enrichment and the students who cannot answer the question as a guide to understand the material being tested.",

There are still many students who have not been actively involved. Lesson plan, module, and students’ worksheet that available have not been able to improve the students’ creativity in solving problems, finding facts, concepts, principles, and laws of physics. One way to improve the students’ creativity was through problem-based learning. The research aims to determine the effect of the implementation of problem-based physics learning to improve students’ creativity. This research uses a quasi-experimental method with one group pre-test post-test design. The research subject was tenth-grade students of Senior High School. Data was collected using an observation sheet, interview guide, and creativity test. Data were analyzed by the normalized gain score and effect size formula. The results of the research show that the effect of problem-based physics learning to improve the students’ creativity was include a large category.\r\nOpen Access",

This\r\nstudy used descriptive survey method with eleven grade student in Bandar Lampung as the\r\npopulation. Beside that, cluster random sampling technique was used to specify the sample. A\r\ncomplex problems as an exercise were given to thirty two senior high school students in order to\r\nproduce alternative statements and the basis of theoretical-evidence relations. The data were\r\nobtained through reasoned multiple choice tests with feedback andanalyzed through a feedbackassessment process. The results showed the increasing of students' argumentation skills in form\r\nof production of alternative statements and counter.",

This was quasi-experiment research with pretest and posttest control group design. Samples were taken using the purposive sampling technique. They were the twelfth-grade students of Public Senior High School 7 in Bandar Lampung and Public Senior High School 1 in North Sungkai. Samples were divided into two groups; the experimental group taught by using a creative-inquiry-based student worksheet and control group taught by using student worksheet sold freely in the market. Instruments used were self-efficacy sheets and problems to test physics problem-solving ability. The data were analyzed by using descriptive analysis with percentage technique, N-gain, and independent t-test. The result showed that a creative inquiry-based student worksheet is effective to be used to improve self-efficacy and ability of physics problem-solving. Good self-efficacy will have implications for the level of physics problem-solving ability in solving physics problems.",

The data of m-learning need is collected using a questionnaire and analyzed using quantitative descriptive analysis. Test design is carried out by the expert of physics (teacher and lecturer of physics). The result of this experiment are (1) scientific approach is not totally applied in physics learning in class yet. (2) lack of supportable learning media straightaway with K-13. (3) Teacher and student need supportable media matched with K-13 that is m-learning. M-learning design which uses a scientific approach for Electricity lesson has some characteristics such as interactive, having educative content, interactive module, presentation material, having electricity animation and videos, experiment simulation, summary, hyperlink to another sources, task, quiz, and discussion forum. The learning steps consist of observing, asking, trying, associating, and communicating. Synchronous learning activities are carried out for discussion forums, asynchronous for the other of it.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to create m-learning design can be used as learning supplement using scientific approach for stimulating students higher order thinking skill. This research used R and D method of ADDIE (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implementation, Evaluation), in this article limited to the design stage. The sample of need analysis consists of 67 Senior High School student and 14 Physics teacher in Lampung. The data of m-learning need is collected using a questionnaire and analyzed using quantitative descriptive analysis. Test design is carried out by the expert of physics (teacher and lecturer of physics). The result of this experiment are (1) scientific approach is not totally applied in physics learning in class yet. (2) lack of supportable learning media straightaway with K-13. (3) Teacher and student need supportable media matched with K-13 that is m-learning. M-learning design which uses a scientific approach for Electricity lesson has some characteristics such as interactive, having educative content, interactive module, presentation material, having electricity animation and videos, experiment simulation, summary, hyperlink to another sources, task, quiz, and discussion forum. The learning steps consist of observing, asking, trying, associating, and communicating. Synchronous learning activities are carried out for discussion forums, asynchronous for the other of it.",
