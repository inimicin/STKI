The development model refers to the stage of the ADDIE model: Analyze, Design, Develop, and Implementation. The stages of development reported in this article are only the analysis and design stages. Needs analysis data obtained through questionnaire distribution, interviews, and document reviews sourced from high school students and teachers in Lampung. Data were analyzed using descriptive qualitative analysis. The results of this study are teachers and students need student worksheet designs that have\r\nthe potential to reduce differences in scientific reasoning and student argumentation performance. Student worksheet designs have the potential to reduce differences in scientific reasoning and argumentation performance on wind and water energy materials that are developed using the PjBl (Project Based Learning) steps and integrated of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) to facilitate students doing problem-solving activities, gathering information, preparing project plans, making\r\nprojects, and communicating. The results of the suitability of the activities in the student worksheets with the STEM approach obtained an average value of 4.3 and the effectiveness of the student worksheets with an average score of 4.3. Based on the results of the assessment, it shows that all components are  assessed to get a score of 4.20-4.5, so the design of this student worksheet is declared very appropriate and can be used to accommodate learning styles and initial knowledge and reduce differences in scientific reasoning and argumentation performance",

The results of the practicality test obtained a percentage of 80.85% with good criteria. The results of the effectiveness\r\ntest showed an N-Gain value of 0.67 with the moderately effective category. From the average pretest and posttest scores, it can be seen that the posttest average score increased by 39.04 which indicates that the use of AR-based worksheets can improve students’ critical thinking. It can be concluded that AR-based worksheets on the concept of dynamic electricity developed are valid, practical, and effective to stimulate students’ critical thinking.",

This research uses Design and Development Research (DDR), consisting of 4 stages: analysis, design, development, and evaluation. The instruments used in this research are interview guidelines, validation test questionnaire, practicality test questionnaire, teacher perception questionnaire, student response questionnaire, and assessment rubrics of scientific processes skill. The result of the validation test results 3,62, with a very valid category. The outcome of the practicality test is 90% as a percentage average, with a very practical as a category. The result of stimulating scientific processes skills through a small team test gets 88% as an average percentage with stimulated as a category. This shows that m-LKPD develops very valid and efficient ways to stimulate processes skills. Besides, m-LKPD creates the potential to be implemented in online learning and face-to-face learning, proven by students’ responses gaining 94% with very good as a category and teachers’ perceptions\r\nthat achieve 96% average percentage with very good as a category. Therefore, the developed m-LKPD can be used as multimedia to support online learning in this Covid-19 pandemic.",

This study uses a mixed method with a qualitative-quantitative explanatory design. The data collection technique used a questionnaire involving 31 respondents, 3 teachers, and 3 students as resource persons in three Islamic high schools in Lampung Province. The results of the study show that AR-assisted methods have the potential to increase teacher-student interaction by implementing a Learning Management System (LMS) that suits their needs and learning facilities. The results also show that AR provides an effective learning experience, because it displays 3D images so that it is easily accepted by students and makes students interested in learning during online learning. Therefore, the use of AR in learning has the opportunity to increase learning interactions between teachers and students.",

      "abstract": "One of the skills of the 21st-century in the era of the industrial revolution 4.0, namely higher-order thinking skills. According to TIMSS, high-level thinking skills in Indonesia are still low. Teaching materials that do not contain 21st-century skills will have an impact on the effectiveness of achieving competence in learning. This study aims to analyze the need for e-modules as teaching materials and to determine the teacher's response to the STEM integrated e-module. This research uses mixed methods. This research was conducted in several high schools in the Lampung area with 20 physics subject teachers as the research subjects. Data collection techniques using questionnaires and interviews. The object of this research is high-level thinking, Problem Based Learning model, and STEM integrated e-module analysis. The results showed that teachers need e-modules as a learning resource that is integrated with STEM to improve higher-order thinking skills. The e-module is expected to be a learning resource that can integrate text, animation, video, and audio and can explain abstract concepts in physics learning. So, in further research, an e-module based on Problem Based Learning with STEM integration can be developed to improve high-level thinking skills.",

The research used mixed methods, which consisted of qualitative data and quantitative data. This research involved 76 respondents spread across several schools in Lampung Province. Based on the preliminary study conducted, it was known that the majority of students want to use STEM-integrated PjBL-based E-Modules as a learning resource with a percentage of 61.9%, while the use of E-Modules as a learning resource used by teachers is still low at only 9.5 %. The preliminary study also saw that the E-Module that was developed later could measure problem-solving abilities with a percentage of 52.4%. Based on this, the use of E-Modules as a learning resource is needed by students, so it is necessary to conduct a needs analysis for the development of an E-Module based on STEM integrated PjBL to improve problem-solving abilities in light refraction material.",

The results of the study revealed that the teachers have never\r\nmade learning resources assisted by the integration between STEM and augmented reality technology. The teachers also revealed that they were anxious that the learning resources that they will use cannot fully meet the competency standards if they are not equipped with learning technology that supports the abstract concepts learning. Thus, the teachers expected technology ssisted learning resources in which texts, images, 3D animations, and videos can be integrated. For further researchers, it is necessary to develop STEM learning resources assisted by augmented reality technology.",

      "abstract": "The accretion process occurs when neutron stars are in a binary system. The hypothesis says that accretion reduces the magnetic field in a neutron star. The correlation between accretion and decrease in the magnetic field is indicated by the magnitude of the magnetic field dynamics and the mass accretion rate. The purpose of this research is to formulate the mass rate of accretion in rapidly rotating neutron stars. The accretion disc is assumed to be at the equator. The method used is theoretical-mathematical analysis. The quantities to be summarized are the Killing vector, 4-vector velocity, the angular velocity, and the Lorentz gamma factor derived from the metric. The metric used is a rapidly rotating neutron star. The rate of mass accretion is calculated from these quantities and the equation for mass sustainability. The equation of mass accretion rate is derived from these variables and the mass conservation equation. The equation of mass accretion rate is affected by the radial velocity of accretion flows and distance between matter and center of a neutron star. The result obtained is covariant with the equation of mass accretion rate for Kerr black holes. The results obtained can provide a dynamic equation for the magnetic field to produce an equation for the decrease in the magnetic field in a rapidly rotating neutron star.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. The aims of this research is to design a STEM Based Physics Multimedia Design for stimulating HOTS on water and wind energy topic. The method in this research is Research and Development using the ADDIE model from Reiser and Mollenda, which consists of five stages, specifically: analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation stages. This study describes the results up to the Analyze and Design stages by descriptive qualitative analysis. Design Stage made with sheet validation by the practitioner using a Likert scale Validator product design consisting of ten professional physics teachers with qualifications Master of Physical Education. The research results obtained that it is needed the development of STEM-\r\nBased Multimedia Design for Stimulating HOTS on Water and Wind Energy topic. The multimedia design that has the potential to stimulate HOTS on the water and wind energy\r\nmateres consists of videos and animation of water and wind energy power plants that contain all components of STEM. Because the design was obtained valid to used, so, further research to develop STEM-based multimedia for stimulating HOTS on water and wind energy materials is needed.",
