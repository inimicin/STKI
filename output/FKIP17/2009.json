      "abstract": "This study was aimed at constructing an authentic assessment model which can'be\r\nused to assess junior high school students' competencies in science (physics). Specifically, it\r\nwas to construct: (a) a set of competencies and indicators, which could be measuled,thrgyOh\r\nintegrative and authentic assessment, (b) a description of an authentic assessmdnt model to\r\nass6ss the students' competencies in Physics, (c) a description of students' and teachers'\r\nresponses to the authentic assessment model to be developed, and {d) informatiol ol \r\n!!?\r\neffectiveness of the authentic assessment model, to be developed, about the students'\r\nachievement, interest, attitude, and learning styles of Physics. This research was a Research\r\nand Development (R and D) research, and was conducted in two phases: (1) the phase of development\r\nani\r\nvalidation\r\nof\r\nthe\r\nmodel,\r\n\r\nand (2) the testing of the effectiveness and applicability of\r\nthe model. ln the first phase, the researcher used a developmental research model, whereas in\r\nthe second phase, he used a quasi-experimental pretest post-test control group non-random\r\ndesign. The'subjects for the try out of the authentic assessment model were Physics teachers\r\nand ihe students of state junior high schools (SMPN) in Bandar Lampung. The schools chosen\r\nwere SMPN 1, SMPN 12, and SMPN 18. They were all located in Bandar Lampung. One class\r\nwas selected from each of the three schools. The schools selected for the try out of the\r\neffectiveness and applicability of the authentic assessment model were SMPN 14 and SMPN\r\n22 Bandar Lampung. Two classes were selected from each of the two schools, one class as an\r\nexperimental group and the other as a control group. The result is in the form of an authentic\r\nassessment modelwhich has been developed to assess the students'competencies in science\r\n(physics). The competencies assessed by the model cover the assessment of conceptual\r\nunderstanding, conceptualization, application, methodology, and affective, and holistic scores\r\nshown by students' chart of competencies. The instruments of the research are the students'\r\nsheet assessment (SSA), and observation sheets (OS), whose validity and reliability have been\r\ntested. The validity and reliability of the instruments for the authentic assessment model are\r\nshown by the results of the try out. The results indicated that there are no significant differences\r\namong the raters in assessing the appropriateness of the components of the SSA and OS. The\r\ninter raters' s@res also show the appropriateness among indicators and assignments of SSA\r\nand OS in assessing the arrangement of the SSA. Furthermore, the results of the try out of the\r\neffectiveness and applicability of the authentic assessment model showed that the\r\nimplementation of this model is effective in increasing the students' attitudes towards Physics,\r\nthe students' learning interest in Physics, the students' learning styles, and the students'\r\nconceptual understanding of Physics. The change of the students' attitudes toward Physics,\r\ntheir interest in learning Physics, their learning styles, and their conceptual understanding of\r\nphysics is more significant than that using the conventional assessment model.",
