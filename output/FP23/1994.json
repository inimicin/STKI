In this study, we evaluated the adsorption-desorption behavior of K+ in the presence of solution Ca2+ (binary) or in the presence of solution Ca2+ plus NH4 (ternary) and the adsorption-desorption behavior of NH+4 in the presence of solution Ca2+ (binary) or in the presence of solution Ca2+ plus K+ (ternary). The soils selected for the study were the Eden, Lowell, and Nicholson soils from Northern Kentucky. These soils are generally known to give poor yield response to fertilizer application. It was shown that potassium adsorption was suppressed by solution NH+4 while NH+4 adsorption was greatly enhanced by solution K+. Adsorption of K+ and NH+4 also increased as pH increased. Ammonium desorption, on the other hand, decreased in the presence of solution K+ relative to that in the absence of solution K+, increased at the medium pH tested, but decreased at the highest pH tested. Furthermore, in general, fixation accounted for most of the adsorbed K+ or NH+4. The results suggested that-predicting exchange or apparent fixation behavior of monovalent cations based on ion size and charge for soils containing vermiculite type minerals is difficult. Experimental exchange data are needed to make accurate binary or ternary cation exchange predictions in such soil systems.",

Intermittent irrigation treatment was conducted once a week from immediately before heading time to harvest time.  The mean CH4 emission rates (mg CH4 4m-2 h-I) during the intermittent irrigation period were in the ranges of 26.6-29.0 and 20.6-27.6 for the chemical fertilizer plots with continuous flooding and intermittent irrigation, respectively. They ranged from 17.9 to 29.0 and 25.2 to 31.7 for the plots treated with both urea and organic materials. These rates were similar to those observed in the same field under continuous flooding during the rainy season cultivation. Thus, the effects of intermittent irrigation were not significant in the paddy field studied.  The total amount of CH4  emitted (g CH4 m-2) throughout the growth  period was 36-45 and 29-44 for the chemical fertilizer plots with continuous flooding and with intermittent irrigation, respectively, while 32-50 and 43-47 from the plots amended with organic materials.",

      "abstract": "Reduction-dissolution kinetics and apparent activation energies (Ea) of reagent grade [beta]-MnO2 (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ), [beta]-MnO2 (Ward's Earth Science, Rochester, NY pyrolusite), and MnOOH (Ward's Earth Science, Rochester, NY manganite) were determined by continuous gasometric analysis employing an isothermal automanometric apparatus. This method was based on pseudo-first-order kinetics of oxygen gas (O2) evolution by reducing the Mn(IV) and\/or Mn(III) to Mn(II). The manganese oxide reduction was carried out employing a solution mixture of 2.4% H2O2 and 9.7% concentrated H2SO4 on a volume basis. The pseudo-first-order constant (k) at 21[degrees]C was 0.66 min-1 for reagent grade [beta]-MnO2, 1.68 min-1 for pyrolusite ([beta]-MnO2), and 0.009 min-1 for manganite (MnOOH). The apparent activation Ea were determined to be 35.56 kJ\/mol-1 for reagent grade [beta]-MnO2, 29.95 kJ\/mol-1 for pyrolusite ([beta]-MnO2), and 44.75 kJ mol-1 for manganite (MnOOH). The most kinetically stable manganese oxide species of the three minerals tested was MnOOH (manganite).",
