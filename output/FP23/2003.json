      "abstract": "An evaluation of crop management factor (C) for coffee using USLE method was conducted in\r\nhilly humid tropical area of Lampung, Indonesia. \r\nThe treatments were as follows : coffe without\r\ncover crop (clean-weeded plot) ; coffee with Paspalum conjugatum as cover crop (Paspalum plot) ;\r\nand co#ee with natural weeds (natural weeds plot). Weed management was done every two\r\nweeks by clearing all the weeds in clean-weeded plot, and cutting the weeds around the co#ee\r\ntrees at a diameter of +m for the weedy plots (Paspalum and natural weeds plots). Two methods\r\nof estimating C-factor for co#ee were used : (+) using similar condition with other crops (Ct), and\r\n(,) using equivalent method based on the existing value of co#ee-C factor (Ce). The results showed\r\nthat the use of Ct gave soil loss prediction 3�,. times higher than that measured, while the use of\r\nCe gave +*�2+ times higher. The predicted values of soil loss using Ct were 1.1 t\/ha\/year and +..+\r\nt\/ha\/year for Paspalum and natural weeds plots respectively. These values were still acceptable\r\nand reasonable to the soil loss tolerance, and very low compared to the other Indonesian studies\r\nwhich could be hundreds of ton\/ha\/y. This experiment showed that the measured co#ee C-factor\r\nwas *.*.\/ for clean-weeded plot, *.**0 for Paspalum plot and *.**. for natural weeds plot, which\r\nwere lower than the common value (*.,) usually used in Indonesia. By introducing the e#ect of\r\nweeds as the weeds C-subfactor (Cs) and co#ee C-factor (Cb) obtained from this experiment\r\nmeasurement, the co#ee C-factor (Cc) with various weeds coverage could be estimated by the\r\nequation Cc�Cb Cs.\r\nKey words : soil erosion, coffee, erodibility, USLE, crop factor",

      "abstract": "In a hilly area in Lampung State, the southern end of Sumatra Island in Indonesia, coffee is commonly cultivated on hillsides with steep slopes and soil erosion affects sustainable coffee production. A field experiment on coffee cultivation was conducted for 4 years to evaluate the effects of alley cropping and no-tillage on the seed production of coffee and on erosion control in a steep slope area in this region. The cultivation of intercropped vegetables, red peppers, tomatoes, and long beans was introduced into the coffee fields when the coffee plants were small. No significant differences in the yields of either the coffee plants or the intercropped vegetables were noted among the treatments. Coffee shoot fresh weight, however, was slightly increased by no-tillage treatment. Soil erosion was reduced by 37% as a result of no tillage and by 64% with alley cropping. The amount of soil erosion for local farmers practice, tillage & no-alley, was more than four times that in no-tillage and alley treatment. These results indicate that alley cropping and no-tillage are effective for erosion control on coffee fields on steep slopes and that yield is not affected by these practices. The introduction of intercropped vegetables is beneficial in terms of farm economy, especially when the income from coffee cultivation is limited.",

      "abstract": "A microcosm experiment was conducted to study the effect of the application of rice straw and compost to a soil on the bacterial communities associated with five species of microcrustaceans in the floodwater of paddy fields based on RFLP analysis. PCR products for bacterial 16S rDNA were digested with four restriction endonucleases (Hinf I, Sau3A I, Hae III, EcoR I). The results showed that the RFLP patterns of the bacterial communities were distinctly different among the microcrustaceans, although DNA fragments common to Tanycypris sp., Cypretta sp., and Heterocypris sp. were recognized. Bacterial communities associated with Tanycypris sp. showed the smallest number of fragments among the microcrustaceans studied. Rice straw and compost application exerted a negligible effect on the band patterns from Cypretta sp. and Moina sp., respectively. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis enabled to separate the band patterns into 2 groups with a total of 4 subgroups: I-1. Moina sp., I-2. Mesocyclops sp., II-1. Tanycypris sp. and Cypretta sp., and II-2. Heterocypris sp. The results indicated that the bacterial association with the microcrustaceans was primarily determined by the genus and species of hosts. Effects of rice straw and compost application on the bacterial communities associated with Moina sp. and Cypretta sp. and the duration of flooding on the bacterial communities associated with all the micro crustaceans were also observed, although the effects were not appreciable compared to those of the kind of host microcrustaceans.",
