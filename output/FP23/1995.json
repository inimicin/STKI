      "abstract": "The Activity of free ionic form of dissolved metals is an important soil solution variable for evaluating the behavior of heavy metals in soil-water-plant system.  This experiment measured the activities of free ionic heavy metal experimentally using donnan analytical technique.  Sample solution (standard solution or soil extract) was equilibrated.with a pure acceptor solution of equal ionic strength to the donor’s (sample solution) through a sheet of donnan ion-exchange membrane.  Only positively charged ions passed through the membrane.  After the donnan equilibrium was reached, the activities of free metal ions in the acceptor solution equaled to the activities of the free ionic dissolved metals in the sample solution (donor solution) and were measured with graphite furnace AAS.  The results show that this technique can measure the activities of free metal ions in natural water system satisfactorily.",

      "abstract": "The effects of rock phosphate (RP) on soil properties and apparent P recovery of corn in acid soil of Sumatra were investigated. The soil was dominated by kaolinitic minerals, very acid and low in extractable phosphorus. The experiment was conducted in two steps: incubation and greenhouse. The treatments were rock phosphate and triple superphosphate (TSP) at 0, 200, 400 and 600 µg P g-1 for the incubation experiment, and at 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 µg P g-1 for greenhouse experiment In the incubation experiment, rock phosphate reduced exchangeable Al and increased pHH2O better than TSP, and supplied Bray-1 extractable P as much as did TSP. In the greenhouse experiment, apparent P recovery values of rock phosphate were very close to those of TSP and the values tended to decrease at higher rates of P. Although corn yields of the rock phosphate treatment were lower than TSP, its relative agronomic effectiveness was quite high.",
