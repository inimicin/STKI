The observation was conducted priodically during the paddy field flooding,  from the beginning of transplanting until the harverst time.  The results showed that twenty-two taxonomical groups of aquatic organisms were found in the four  ocation   as followed:  19 groups were at conventional paddy field Taman Bogo, 15 groups were at  convensional paddy field Pagelaran, 14 groups were at organic paddy field at Pagelaran and 12 groups were found at organic paddy fields Pagelaran with microcosm methods. The  iversity indices were not significance difference  mong location of paddy field because of  ominantly by some  quatic organisms such as the groups of Cladocera,  yclopoida, Podocopida, Ploima, Zygnemetales, and   lvocida.  Cluster analysis and principal analysis showed that the communities structure of organic paddy field microcosm from Pagelaran  was at different group with others.",

      "abstract": "An experiment was conducted with the objective to investigate the influence of available water deficit in typical soil types on the yield and crop water requirement of soybeans in Indonesia. This research was conducted in a plastic greenhouse of the University of Lampung from June to August 2005. A factorial experiment was arranged in randomized block design with three replications. The soil type (S) was the first factor with two different soil types, Ultisol (S1), and Latosol (S2). Water deficit (D) was the second factor with five levels including D1 (0-20%), D2 (20-40%), D3 (40-60%), D4 (60-80%), and D5 (80-100%) of water deficit from the total available water (TAW). For example, D1 (0-20%) meant that water was given to maintain the available water depletion between 0% and 20% of TAW in the root zone. Yield under full irrigation in Ultisol (21.3 g\/pot) was 2.3 times as much as in Latosol (9.3 g\/pot). Yield efficiency (the ratio of yield to crop water requirement) in Ultisol was the greatest under deficit irrigation of 30% of available water deficit (0.0083 g\/g), which was 1.26 times as much as under full irrigation (0.0066 g\/g). However, yield efficiency of Latosol was the greatest under full irrigation (0.0049 g\/g). Therefore, yield efficiency of soybean in Ultisol was 1.8 times as much as in Latosol."

      "abstract": "The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of water stress in regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) on the yield of soybean growing on Ultisol soil. This research was conducted under plastic house on the experimental farm of Lampung Polytechnique from August to November 2004. The water stress treatments in regulated deficit irrigation were ET1 (1.0 × ETc), ET2 (0.8 × ETc), ET3 (0.6 × ETc), ET4 (0.4 × ETc) and ET5 (0.2 × ETc), arranged in a randomized block design with four replications. ETc means crop evapotranspiration under standard condition, which was well watered. For example, the ET2 (0.8 × ETc) treatment means that the amount of supplied water per a day is the same as the crop adjustment evapotranspiration (ETcadj) with the value 0.8 of water stress coefficient (K s). The RDI treatments were carried out just at vegetative phase and its treatments were stopped at the beginning of flowering phase, and afterwards the treatments were watered at 1.0 × ETc. The results showed that since week II, the soybean experienced stress throughout the growth period except ET2 treatment. ET2 treatment started to be stressed at week V and continued to be stressed until the harvest time. At the ET3 treatment, the critical water content (θc) of soybean was reached at week II, and the θc was 0.24 m3\/m3 on the average. The RDI at vegetative period significantly affected the yield. The highest yield was ET1 (35.2 g\/plant), followed by ET2 (31.0 g\/plant), ET3 (18.1 g\/plant), ET4 (7.6 g\/plant), and ET5 (3.3 g\/plant). The optimal water management of soybean with the highest yield efficiency was regulated deficit irrigation with water stress coefficient (K s) of 0.80 for vegetative phase.\r\n\r\nKeywords\r\nUltisol Water stress coefficient Yield efficiency Optimal water management",

This research was conducted to study the activities of acid and alkaline phosphatases in earthworm casts of coffee field with different plant cover management. Earthworm casts were sampled from experimental coffee fields in Sumber Jaya, West Lampung on September 2001 (dry season), April 2002 (rainy season), and July 2002 (end of rainy season).  The experimental fields were previously prepared and arranged in a randomized block design with seven different plant cover management arranged in three blocks.  The results showed that the activities of acid phosphatase in coffee field with round-weeded Paspalum conjugatum, coffee field with round-weeded native weeds, coffee field with row-grown native weeds, and native weeds without coffee plants were the same and higher than in coffee field with row-grown P. cojugatum, coffee field without weeds, and ploughed field without coffee and weeds, except in the end of rainy season 2002.  It showed that the amount and diversity of organic matter that eaten by earthworms influenced the acitivity of microorganisms and acid phosphatase in earthworm cast. Whereas, the highest activity of alkaline phosphatase was in coffee field with round-weeded P. conjugatum, except in rainy season of 2002. It related to C\/N ratio of P. conjugatum that lower than other weeds so that it can stimulate the growth of earthworm to produce alkaline phosphatase. Different from soil, activities of phosphatases in earthworm casts showed no correlation with pH, organic-C, total-N, and available-P.",

Three plots, a weeded plot (T-1; the common practice), a plot covered with Paspalum conjugatum Berg., a C plant (T-2), and a plot in which native weeds were allowed to grow (T-3), were prepared. An incubation experiment determined the 13 C values of the humus fractions generated from Paspalum in soil. Based on the increase in 13 C value, the proportion of total C that originated from Paspalum C after 4 years under coffee was 16 _ 4% in the T-2 topsoil (0–10 cm). Humic and fulvic acids in the T-1 topsoil decreased to 46 and 84%, respectively, whilst both increased or remained constant in the T-2 and T-3 soils. The WS-NHS content varied little and was independent of land management. The preferential loss of the humic acids with a smaller degree of humiﬁcation as assessed by their darkness in colour was shown in T-1. The decrease in the degree of humiﬁcation suggested the accumulation of the weedderived humic acids in T-2 and T-3. In the T-2 topsoil, 36 _ 2%, 13 _ 3% and 15 _ 2% of C in the humic acids, fulvic acids and WS-NHS, respectively, were estimated to be Paspalum-derived after 4 years. The estimated initial C loss during the same period was 17 _ 3%, 14 _ 2% and 7 _ 2%, respectively, for those fractions, which suggests the fastest turnover rate for the humic acids and signiﬁcant retardation of their degradation in soil colonized by weeds",

This research sought to evaluate the changes in enzymatic activities in cornfield soil enriched with organic matter. Corn field plots had been treated for 8 seasons with increasing amounts of green manure or barnyard manure (0 – 100% of 20 ton ha-1) and decreasing amount of chemical fertilizers (100 – 0% of 300 kg Urea + 200 kg SP-36 + 100 kg KCl ha-1). Soil samples were taken at the maximum vegetative stage and at harvest time, and analyzed for enzymatic and chemical properties. The results clearly showed that enrichment with barnyard manure significantly increased alkaline phosphatase activity. Both manures did not affect the activities of acid phosphatase, arylsulfatase and β-glucosidase. The greater effect of barnyard manure on alkaline phosphatase was closely related with increases in soil pH, available P, and microbial activities. Barnyard manure also significantly increased organic C and total N content. The activities of acid and alkaline phosphatase, arylsulfatase, and β-glucosidase showed high and significant correlations with soil pH, organic C, total N, and available P. Acid phosphatase showed a significant correlation with corn yield.",
