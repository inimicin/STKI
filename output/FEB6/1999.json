      "abstract": "This study provides an investigation into the link between financial constraints and cash holdings from the perspective of a developing country. It is based on the view that managers acting as agents are managing firms on behalf of shareholders, which is leading to agency conflicts and hence giving rise to the Free Cash Flow hypothesis. In addition, the management of cash looks at liquidity as well as the resources of a firm in order to invest in future growth. The current study thus provides a comparison of the value of excess cash holdings by examining the impact of financial constraints. The analysis is based on a single dimension, as well as multiple criteria dimensions, where the findings indicate that excess cash holding is less valuable for unconstrained companies. This suggests that agency problems are the main motives behind excess cash holdings for these companies. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the values are large for constrained firms providing insights into the need for managers of these companies to evaluate cash management strategies in order to enhance corporate value. Furthermore, it provides useful insight for regulators as well as shareholders in terms of the importance of governing and regulating capital markets in the context of a developing country despite having significantly lower balances relative to developed markets.",

      "abstract": "Energy plays crucial role in economic development of country to contribute in business activities for large sectors. The availability of energy helps to fulfill the development demands and initiatives of government’s policies. Energy is required in any sector of country to conduct their business activities and to develop infrastructure sector in Indonesia. Strategic management of firms enables them to develop long-term goals and to gain competitive advantage in highly turbulent and rapidly changing environment. The present study empirically examined the influence of strategic management practices and strategic clarity on performance of energy sector of Indonesia. Moderating role of corporate social responsibility is also examined between the constructs. The results show that independent variables influence significantly performance of firms, but CSR doesn’t moderate between the strategic clarity and firms’ performance. The data was collected from industry related mangers and was examined by using SMART-PLS (MM and SEM techniques).",
