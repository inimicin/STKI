The population in this study were all fifth grade elementary school students at SDN Metro Pusat cluster\r\nnusa indah. The sample was taken using simple random sampling technique, taking 2 classes from 14 classes in\r\nthe population, which consisted of one class as a trial class totaling 22 students from the VB class of SD Negeri\r\n2 Metro Pusat and one class as a sample. totaling 37 students in VA class at SD Negeri 1 Metro Pusat. Data was collected through questionnaires and test questions. The results showed that the test instruments developed were valid and reliable. Based on the assessment of 3 experts, the average is 81.75 including in the very good category. Whereas based on the results of the empirical test, 20 description questions developed were declared to be 0.90 valid and 0.989 reliability was included in the very strong category",

The purpose of this study is to analyze \r\nthe implementation of the scientific method of teaching social science subjects and \r\neducational character in the affective domain. To do so, we engaged in research using quasi-\r\nexperimental methods. A random sample of 40 students was chosen. Data were collected \r\nusing a questionnaire on students’ character consisting of three aspects: reasoning, feeling, \r\nand behavior. The data have a normal distribution with a significant value of 0.966 and \r\nare homogeneous with a significant value of 0.100 > 0.05. The data were analyzed using \r\na paired sample \r\nT\r\n-test. The character value of social studies learners, after being taught \r\nusing the scientific method, was higher than ever with a significance of 0.000 < 0.05. The \r\ncharacter of students in the affective domain was influenced by the feelings aspect resulting \r\nfrom the scientific method. Thus, using the scientific method in educational interventions \r\nimproved the character of fifth-grade elementary school students.\r\nKeywords:\r\nAffective domain, elementary school, character education, scientific method",

This type of research is research and development that refers to the theory of Borg and Gall. The study population was the fourth grade students of the Raden Intan Front Cluster in Bumi Nabung Subdistrict and the research sample was fourth grade students of Elementary School 5 Bumi Nabung Ilir. Data collection techniques use nontes and test techniques. Data collection tools in the form of questionnaires\r\nand test questions. Data were analyzed using validity test and N-Gain effectiveness test. The results showed that (1) worksheet based-guided inquiry learning developed through Borg and Gall theory was valid based on suitability with guided inquiry learning steps and quality of worksheet, conformity with didactic, construction, and technical requirements, and in accordance with grammar rules. (2) worksheet based-guided inquiry learning is effective to foster students' critical thinking skills as indicated by the average N-Gain of 0.67 with the category \"Medium\"",
