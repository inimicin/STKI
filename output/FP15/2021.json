      "abstract": "This study aims to analyze the added value of the aromatic component\r\nof Robusta coffee flowers in Lampung Province. The research method is done by\r\ndescriptive analysis. There are three extraction processes in this research, after\r\nobtaining the oil yield from each extraction, one method is chosen to produce the\r\nbest oil aroma and its added value is analyzed. Calculation of added value using\r\nthe Hayami method for analysis. The yield of fragrance that most closely\r\nresembles natural coffee flowers will be calculated on the analysis of added value\r\nor benefits. Based on organoleptic tests, the aroma that most closely resembles\r\nnatural coffee flowers is coffee flowers extracted by a rotary evaporation method\r\nin which the raw material for coffee flowers is taken \/ harvested in the phase\r\nbefore pollination (yield of 16.1%). The added value of processing aromatic\r\nextracts of coffee flowers (Rotary Evaporation method) with raw materials as\r\nmuch as 1 kg, which is IDR 933,923 and obtained a ratio value of 82.3%. The\r\nadded value of this aromatic component of coffee flowers falls into the high\r\ncategory (>40%). The profit gained one time production of coffee flowers into\r\ncoffee flower oil is IDR 553.923 with a profit rate of 59,3 %.",

      "abstract": "The study's objective was to evaluate the cream cheese characteristics made from Lampung farmer's milk improved by combining 2% xanthan gum and 1% gelatin as stabilizers on different curd recovery ways. The cream cheese samples were prepared by three treatments, namely (T1) stabilizer application on curd without whey separation, (T2) no stabilizer application on curd with whey separation, and (T3) stabilizer application on curd with whey separation. All experiments were repeated three times. Results demonstrated that the addition of stabilizer (xanthan gum and gelatin) with or without whey separation had a better impact on the proportional protein, fat, yield, and texture, and spreadability.  In addition, stabilizer addition had no adverse effect on the color, taste, and aroma of all cheese cream. Nevertheless, cream cheese without whey separation had higher moisture content than those with whey separation even though with stabilizer added. Therefore, it was possible to explore cream cheese made from Lampung farmers' milk with a stabilizer and whey separation application",
