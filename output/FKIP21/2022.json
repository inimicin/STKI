The research sample was \r\ngrade XI students of a senior highschool in Bandarlampung which obtained by using purposive \r\nsampling technique. In the control class, direct instruction learning was applied and in the \r\nexperimental class was the inquiry lesson. The research used a quasi-experimental design with \r\nThe Matching-Only Pretest- Post-test Control Group. The research data were analyzed using the \r\nn-gain calculation and parametric statistics with the t-test. The results showed that the post-test average score of critical thinking skills in the experimental class and the control class had a significant difference and the average n-gain in the experimental class was 0.48 (moderate category). Thus, it can be concluded that the Inquiry Lesson model is effective for improving students' critical thinking skills.\r\nKey words: Inquiry lesson, buffer solution, critical thinking skills",

      "abstract": "21st century education aims to improve students' scientific literacy skills. The results of the PISA study show that the scientific literacy of Indonesian students is in the low category. The low scientific literacy of students is caused by several factors in the education system, such as the curriculum, teachers, and students themselves. This study aims to describe the scientific literacy ability of Class IX.A students of MTs Negeri 1 West Lampung and the factors that influence it. Information about scientific literacy skills is important to know in order to provide appropriate solutions to the problems faced, especially in the field of scientific literacy. This research is a descriptive research with a combination method (mixed method). The research sample was 28 students who were taken by cluster random sampling technique. The instruments used were scientific literacy test questions and interview guide sheets. The data analysis technique was carried out by giving a score for each student's answer then interpreted into the value and category of scientific literacy achievement and analyzing the results of the interview. Based on the results of the study, it is known that the average value of scientific literacy for Class IX.A students at MTs Negeri 1 Lampung Barat is 36.19 with a low category. The low scientific literacy ability of these students is influenced by several factors, namely low interest in reading, evaluation tools that have not led to the development of scientific literacy, lack of teacher knowledge about scientific literacy, and teaching materials that are able to develop scientific literacy skills.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the scientific attitude of prospective science teacher students as well as to validate the scientific attitude assessment instrument that had been developed (Moore & Foy, 1997). This research procedure includes adapting the instrument, analyzing the content validity, delivering the instrument to sample and evaluating the research data. The data obtained were analyzed statistically using factor analysis techniques to determine the contribution of each item, analysis the reliablity and Pearson product moment correlation. The research sample was 525 prospective science teachers who were taken by using random technique at University of Lampung. The results showed that scientific attitude consisted of 4 main factors, namely science is about understanding, explaining, and aiming to help other people's lives better (factor 1), I want to become a scientist (factor 2), the task of a scientist (factor 3), and science is rigid (factor 4). Furthermore, factor 3 and factor 1 as the dominant scientific attitude possessed by students, followed by factor 2 and factor 4. The scientific attitude was dominated by the understanding that science is about understanding and explaining scientific facts and the obligations of a scientist. . But they themselves do not really want to be a scientist.

      "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the concern of prospective chemistry teacher students towards the environment using a questionnaire. green chemistry attitude. The data obtained were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) techniques to determine the contribution of each item, the level of student mastery, and the interrelationship between the dimensions of green chemistry attitudes. The research sample was 200 students who were taken by random sampling technique from the total number of students from the Department of Chemistry Education, FKIP, University of Lampung. The results showed that the 15 statement items in the instrument grouped into 4 factors, namely prevention, design for energy efficiency, safer solvent and auxiliaries, design for degradation. Each statement item and factor have a fairly good validity and reliability in terms of the standard rotated factor loadings and the Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Furthermore, the mean and grandmean analysis revealed that most of the prospective students for chemistry teacher at FKIP Unila had a positive attitude towards the concept of recycling in chemical processes and the use of solvents that were safe for the environment. Each factor also shows a strong correlation with each other in terms of the Pearson correlation coefficient. Finally, this instrument is highly recommended for further research in revealing teacher candidates' concern for the environment.\r\n\r\nKeywords: green chemistry attitude scale, prospective chemistry teachers, factor analysis.\r\n\r\nAbstract: Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengevaluasi kepedulian calon guru kimia terhadap lingkungan dengan menggunakan green chemistry attitude scale. Data yang diperoleh dianalisis dengan teknik exploratory factor analysis (EFA) untuk mengetahui kontribusi tiap butir soal, tingkat ketuntasan siswa, dan keterkaitan antar dimensi sikap green chemistry. Sampel penelitian adalah 200 mahasiswa yang diambil dengan teknik random sampling dari total mahasiswa Jurusan Pendidikan Kimia FKIP Universitas Lampung. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa 15 item pernyataan dalam instrumen dikelompokkan menjadi 4 faktor yaitu pencegahan, desain untuk efisiensi energi, pelarut dan bahan tambahan yang lebih aman, desain untuk degradasi. Setiap item dan faktor memiliki validitas dan reliabilitas yang cukup baik ditinjau dari standard rotated factor loeading dan koefisien alfa Cronbach. Selanjutnya, analisis mean dan grandmean mengungkapkan bahwa sebagian besar calon guru kimia di FKIP Unila memiliki sikap positif terhadap konsep daur ulang dalam proses kimia dan penggunaan pelarut yang aman bagi lingkungan. Masing-masing faktor juga menunjukkan korelasi yang kuat satu sama lain dilihat dari koefisien korelasi Pearson. Terakhir, instrumen ini sangat direkomendasikan untuk penelitian lebih lanjut dalam mengungkap kepedulian calon guru terhadap lingkungan.",

      "abstract": "In some places of the world, disasters occur virtually every day. If disasters are not properly foreseen, they may result in many fatalities. This research aims to examine the growth and pattern of literature on natural disaster education in schools. This analytical strategy combines quantitative and statistical methods to discover trends, assess quality, and track development. A total of 216 documents were chosen from the 403 documents collected. Following 2015, there was a considerable increase in four-year publications. Authors from the United States contributed to 45 papers with 37% citations and ranked first, followed by authors from Japan (31 documents; 15% citations) and Indonesia (31 documents) with rankings citations below the top 10. Most publications were published in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction (12 docs; Q1 Scimago Journal Rank 1.1 (SJR 1.1)). The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines had the most citations (100; Q1 SJR 3.6) and was ranked first in its discipline. The existing core literature on school education on natural disasters demonstrates that this topic is developing rapidly, but with insufficient international research collaboration. Research cooperation in this area must be strengthened to better the global response to natural disaster mitigation, which should begin in schools worldwide. There is a need to widen the scope of study in this field to include natural disaster preparedness education in the school curriculum, assessments, learning media, disaster response education, and instructional designs. Finally, disaster education in schools must be addressed as soon as possible to contribute to disaster preparedness"

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the motivation for learning chemistry and smart risk-taking behavior in dealing with online learning during the covid-19 pandemic. Descriptive qualitative research design is used to obtain research data to obtain conclusions. The research subjects included students of the Chemistry Education Study Program, FKIP University of Lampung, semester 1 (class of 2021), semester 3 (class of 2020), and semester 5 (class of 2019) with a total of 158 people. The research data were collected using a motivational questionnaire and the IRT-S scale which were distributed via google form and observation in vclass.unila.ac.id mode to obtain data on the learning process. The results showed that ((1) students still do not have high motivation to take online lectures. (2) During online learning, students lack the courage to take risks smartly (low SRTB) in learning, only a relatively high preference for chemistry (more than 50%) students state that they dare to do new things, while others such as belief themselves in taking risks smartly in learning is relatively low. (3) Students who have high motivation and are more interested in science, then these students will also have the courage to take risks intelligently when studying. The results of this study indicate that students' low online learning motivation causes students' lack of courage in taking risks to learn smartly. With the results obtained from this study, it is necessary to follow up that in online learning, there should be more nuances of chemistry learning that can support smart risk-taking behavior for students.",
