      "abstract": "Classification of text documents is a fundamental problem and important. In a text document, which contained writings is a natural human language, which is a language with a complex structure and the number of words very much. Therefore, this problem is very challenging due to the use of natural language. This paper discusses the document classification method by using the concept of ID3 algorithm, by taking into account the number of times the word appears in the text document. In contrast to these methods, such methods are also discussed Naive Bayes Classifier, which is a method to calculate the chance appearance of the word, and the method of K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), which is a method that takes into account the number of times the word similarity between a document with other documents. In this study, we tried to do experiments on the data to determine the accuracy of ID3 algorithm, Naive Bayes and KNN for use in a text document classification problem the Indonesian language. The contribution of this research is to provide a comparison of the accuracy of ID3 algorithm, Naïve Bayes and KNN for classification of documents Indonesian news."

      "abstract": "The vast amount of information in the Internet is not\r\neasy to find and use. Information Extraction technology is one of alternatives that can solve this problem. Conventional Natural Language Processing approach is hampered by its portability, scalability and adaptability. Introduction of Machine Learning into Information extraction is one of solutions. Inductive Learning only needs annotated training examples. The problem is there is no performance consistency of algorithms on various\r\ninformation domains. Automatic and smart classifier selection from various machine learning algorithms is one of the best way to handle this problem. The goal of this paper is to propose a method for Information Extraction System based on Inductive Learning and Meta Learning that have good performance. In this paper Multi-Inductive Learning is developed to answer that question. Multi-Inductive Learning is consist of several Inductive Learning algorithms that have significant difference in their mechanism. This is to ensure there is bias variance in this\r\nmethod. Through k-fold cross validation on training document, Multi-Inductive Learning algorithm can choose the best classifier for each slot on a certain domain. These best classifiers then employ to do full extraction on testing document. The conducted experiment shows that Multi-Inductive Learning has better performance than that of single Inductive Learning algorithm based Information Extraction systems. On Reuters Corporate Acquisition, Multi-Inductive Learning gives a score of 46.3 % and has the best performance among other state of the art information systems. Out of nine slots that should be extracted,\r\nsix of them give the best performance. Multi-Inductive Learning also gives better performance on Job Posting dataset. Average performance of it gives 82.1 % and is the best among other state of the art of Information Extraction. Out of 17 slots that should be tested, nine of them are extracted with the best performance.",
