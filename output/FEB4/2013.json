The participant in total 60 students comes from BPK Penabur\r\nSenior High School as a control group, and Perintis 2 Senior High School Bandarlampung as an\r\nexperiment group.\r\nThe independent t-test result shows that student learning achievement using mathematics-based\r\nmethod is statistically equal with conventional method in both competencies; debit or credit\r\npositioning and transaction analyzing.
