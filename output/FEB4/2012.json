The result of this study using man whitney t-test, multiple regression, and moderated regression analysis finds that: 1) There are significant differences between the book value of equity with a market value of equity. Over the last three years (2007,2008,2009), the average equity market value is much higher than the book value of equity, 2)  ROA (possitive and significant), debt to equity ratio (possitive and significant), intangible assets (possitive and significant) effected on firm value, but earning quality has not effected on firm value 3) Earning quality as a moderating variable has not proved affect the relationship between current ratio, ROA,  debt to equity, asset turnover and firm value.",

Respondents were auditors of acounting firms located in Jakarta (N=151). Result of the hierarchical regression analysis showed that organizational commitment had no mediating effect on the relationship between job satisfaction and job performance. Besides that, job satisfaction had an effect to affective commitment, continuance commitment, and normative commitment. Organizational commitment had no effect to job performance.

      "abstract": "This study aimed to test the usefulness of accounting information and market of the CEO turnover issues in Indonesia. The results of this study is planned for the long term to capture the overall factors that affect CEO turnover in Indonesia, not only from the accounting side but also from market side, so it can make a significant contribution for the company strategy to determine the corporate governance’ setting. Previous research show inconclusive results about CEO turnover is whether the antecedent factors and consequences. Also, the issue of CEO turnover research is still very rarely done in Indonesia, since the turn of information not generally available.\r\nThe sample used is all firms that are identified through the turn (either routine or non- routine) in the company's top management level (in this case is President Director). The main advantage of this study is to use the sample all firms that conduct the CEO turnover period 1998-2005, and subsequently determine the accounting variables that allegedly able to explain these changes. For the companies that during the year observations is never do turnover action we define as a control sample. Final sample that we used for testing accounting data is as much as 140 companies, consisting of 81 companies that make the turnover and the 59 companies that did not. For the final sample testing of market data totaled 131 firms, consisting of 77 companies that make the turnover and the 54 companies that did not. Final sample for the second data source is set after considering the availability of data and the confounding effects during the observation period.\r\nBoth of accounting data and market data are tested using logit models (separately), because the dependent variable used is a binary variable, 1 for turnover and 0 for others. The results of test show that accounting data (i.e. Total Asset, Total Sales, ROA, ROE and Earnings), statistically have a negative significant effect of turnover decisions while CurRatio and D\/ Equity is not significant. The results of test for market data show the performance of stock prices statistically negative significant effect, while market risk have a statistically positive significant effect. This finding is consistent with previous research which states that in the CEO turnover decision making, the company will consider the performance of accounting and market performance achievements of the CEO. From the results of different test using paired samples t-test, we found the stock price rose significantly after the turn while the risk of being seen significant decreases. These findings reveal a positive response to the changing market. And finally, from the analysis of this study we conclude that the better performance of both (accounting and market) then there is a tendency for the incumbent CEO who will not be fired and the worse the performance of both the CEO who is appointed will have the potential to be replaced (down position or enter to the board of commissioners) and fired from the company as ultimatelly.",

The contribution of this study is to provide empirical evidence about the existence of perceived of justice by the CEO in the term of compensation when they succeeded create the value of the firm. It is important to ensure the sustainability of performance, even encourage CEO loyalty to the firm. The samples used are as many as 395 firms-years with growth data used are from the firm's annual report, period 2005-2008. The growth of the corporate performance for three consecutive periods (2005\/2006; 2006\/2007, and 2007\/2008), then compared it with the amount (growth) of compensation received by CEOs.\r\n\r\nTest results showed that the growth of the corporate performance growth has a positive relationship to the amount of compensation received by the CEO in Indonesia. Two of three financial performance used in the model, the net income and total assets, are significantly linked to the amount of compensation received by CEOs. While stock price is not show a relationship with what the theory predicted. With these findings, the research hypothesis that says the growth of the company's performance was positively related to the amount of compensation received by the CEO, statistically supported.",
