IOS proxy that is used in this research is proxy based on value that is market to book value of equity (MVEBVE). To prove IOS proxy validation, we earlier prove empirically that is significantly different between market value and book value.\r\nThe selection of samples is done by purposive judgment sampling method. This sample researches are 53 companies from 148 manufacture companies which are registered in Indonesian Stock Exchange. The researcher use paired sample t-test as analytical test to try the first hypothesis. Whereas to 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th IOS’ are correlated with growth realization by use one-tailed percent correlation. Growth realization of company is proxies by growth of assets, equity, sales and earnings.\r\nThe result of paired-sample t-test shows that there is significantly different between market value and book value so that proportion ratio of market value and book value can be used as IOS proxy that valid enough. Whereas the test result use one-tailed pearson correlation with significant rate (ά) : 1% shows that there is significant positive correlation between IOS and assets growth realization, equity and selling. For IOS correlation and earning growth realization there is positive correlation but not significant. It is maybe caused by earning assignment sample’s company for dividend is bigger than earning assignment for retained earning.",

The hypotheses which are proposed in this research are H1: permanent earnings are more accurate than aggregate earnings in prediction future operational cash flow, and H2: operational cash flow is more accurate than aggregate earnings in prediction future operational cash flow. The researcher uses test instruments panel data regression to make efficient regression panel data model. The samples in this research are 29 companies from 148 manufactory companies which are registrant in Indonesian Stock Exchange. The dependent variable is operational cash flow, whereas independent variables are permanent earnings, aggregate earnings and operational cash flow. The accuracy comparison of prediction model is done by comparing the value of prediction error by using absolute percentage error (APE). The result of test by using Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test with real rate 5% prove that permanent earnings is not different from the accuracy with aggregate earnings in prediction future operational cash flow. Empirical evidence also shows that operational cash flow is more accurate than aggregate earnings in prediction future operational cash flow.",

      "abstract": "The Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards needs to adopt IFRS, so that the Indonesian financial reports can be accepted globally and the Indonesian companies are able to enter the global competition to attract the international investors. Currently, the adoption by Indonesian PSAK is in the form of harmonization, which means partial adoption. However, Indonesian is planning to fully adopt the IFRS by 2012. Such an adoption will be mandatory for listed and multinational companies.  The decision as to whether Indonesia will fully adopt the IFRS or partly adopt for harmonization purposes needs to be considered carefully. Full adoption of IFRS will enhance the reliability and comparability of the financial reports internationally. However, it may contradict the Indonesian tax systems and other economic and political situations.  If Indonesia were to adopt fully the IFRS by 2012, the challenges are faced firstly by the academic society and the companies. The curriculum, syllabi, and literature need to be adjusted to accommodate the changes. These will take considerable time and efforts due to the many aspects related to the changes. Adjustments also need to be done by corporations or organizations, particularly those with international transactions and interactions.  Full adoption also means the changing of accounting principles that has been applied as accounting standards worldwide. This might not be achieved in a short period, due to a number of reasons: (1) accounting standards are highly related with the tax systems. Adoption  to IFRS internationally may change the tax systems in each country that fully adopt the IFRS. (2) Accounting standards are accounting policies in order to fulfil the national political and economic necessities that vary in each country. This might be the significant challenges in fully adopting the IFRS.",
