      "abstract": "Indonesia became an area passed by the Pacific Ring of Fire which was the meeting place of \r\ntwo active tectonic plates, which caused Indonesia to have many volcanoes. One of them is Mount \r\nMerapi. Mount Merapi is located on the border between Central Java and the Special Region of \r\nYogyakarta, which is located at 7o32.5'LS and 110o26.5'W with an altitude of 2,978 diameters of 28 km, \r\nan area of 300-400 km2\r\nand a volume of 150 km3\r\n. Merapi is a stratovolcano-type volcano with a coneï¿½shaped andesite-basaltic type of magma. Seismic method aims to find out more the characteristics of the \r\nvolcano. One indicator to see the early possibility of eruption is the occurrence of volcanic type \r\nearthquake (VTA) which is then accompanied by the emergence of shallow volcanic type earthquake \r\n(VTB). Volcanic earthquake data of Mount Merapi which can be as many as 5 volcanic earthquake \r\nevents in the period of August 18, 2017 to August 31, 2017. Hypocenter points obtained have varying \r\ndepth at different times. The accuracy of hyposenter points can be influenced by the picking results of the \r\narrival time of the primary wave. We can conclude that in the period August 18, 2017 to August 31, 2017 \r\nis a type of deep volcanic earthquake.",
