Therefore, one way that\r\ncould be attempted is creating suppressive soil in the form of applying biofertilizer such\r\nas rhizobium (Nitrogen Fixing Bakteria).

The first factor was the type of Rhizobium (control, Shinorhizobium sp (S8.4),\r\nRhizobium sp (S10.3.1) which was inoculated on the plant Paraserianthes falcataria.\r\nPlanting medium used was sterilized soil from ex-cement mining land.

      "abstract": "The main weaknesses of particleboard are that it has a lower strength and a lower dimensional stability compared to solid wood. Therefore, in order to gain excellent properties prior to be used, it needs some treatments, i.e., resin thermoplastic laminated. The objectives of this study were to improve the physical and mechanical properties of rubber wood particleboard laminated with low density ethylene (LDPE) resin. Rubber wood particleboard was laminated with 4 different concentrations of LDPE resins (i.e., 5, 10, 15, and 20%). The physical and mechanical properties of board were evaluated both in dry and wet states. The results indicated that the dimensional stability of board\r\nafter laminated with LDPE resin showed significant improvement in term of water absorption and thickness swelling. Modulus of rupture and srew resistant of resulted particle board were increased with addition of LDPE resin. Modulus of elasticity and surface hardness of the particleboard were slightly decreased with addition of LDPE resin.  The intenal bond was unchanged.  The best treatment was found on  lamination the surface of particleboard with 5% LDPE resin. All the physical and mechanical properties of particleboard laminated with 5% LDPE resin met the requirements of JIS A 5908-2003 standard.",

Three-layer OSBs were made using Betung bamboo (Dendrocalamus asper (Schultes.f) Backer ex Heyne) strands to evaluate the effects of strand length and pre-treatment techniques on the physical, mechanical, and durability properties. Three different strand lengths, namely 50, 60, and 70 mm, were prepared. Prior to the manufacture into OSB, the strands were immersed in cold water for 24 h and in 6% acetic anhydrides solution for 48 h. The OSBs were fabricated using 5% MDI resin based on the strand dry weight. The results indicated that MOR and MOE values in perpendicular to the grain direction were much influenced by strand length. The dimensional stability of OSB was slightly improved by immersing the strands in acetic anhydride solution. Immersing strands in cold water and acetic anhydride solution improved the resistance of OSB against subterranean termite (Macrotermes gylvus) attack under the adopted experimental condition. All OSB parameters manufactured in this experiment were better than the minimum requirement of CSA 0437.0 (Grade O–2) standard.",

      "abstract": "Honey forest are one of beekeeping product that can developed by honey bees breeding method. In order to remain sustainable production of honey breeding, agood breeding management is significantly needed. The purpose of this research was to identify and evaluate the breeding management of Apis cerana Fabr. honey bee based on the indicator and parameter assessment of technical requirement planning, the technique, the implementation, and the products of breeding. This research was conducted from February 2012 until April 2012 in the Buana Sakti Village, District of Batanghari, East Lampung. The method used in this research is field observations and questionnairy interviews. The analysis applied in this reseacrh is quantitative and qualitative method, comparing the data collection from the field to the criteria and indicator of breeding management assessment. The results of this research showed that the aspect of technical requirement planning and the breeding products are considered good, it is because it has accomplished the requirement. While the aspect of breeding technique and implementation are considered not good, it is caused by the limited competence of bee farmer and the breeding methods. Overally, the breeding management of Apis cerana Fabr. honey bee in Buana Sakti village for all aspects is considered good. The breeding management of Apis cerana Fabr. honey bee in Buana Sakti village needs to be well improved, particularly in term of technique and implemetation of breeding to obtain the maximum quality of honey bee breeding.",

The result of the research shows that adult male and female of sumateranus elephant have the same natural salting behaviour. The natural salting bahaviour is divided into 4 division based on the shepherding place, the are swamp, savannah, edge, and mudhole. Salting frequency is influenced by 3 factors they are the availability of woof, condition of health, and weather. The longest salting duration in mudhole. The way of salting is utilizing organs among others: trunk, tusks, ang feet. The average of salt inside the soil in salting place is 0,0133%",
