      "abstract": "Mutun Beach is a tourist attraction in Pesawaran Regency, which has the advantage of being marine tourism. This study aimed to determine how the tourism development strategy at Mutun Beach is expected to increase tourist attraction and local revenue. This study uses a SWOT analysis tool consisting of 4 stages: identifying internal and external factors, creating a SWOT Matrix, analyzing the IFAS Matrix and EFAS Matrix, and creating a SWOT Quadrant. Fifteen selected expert respondents filled out this questionnaire. The results of this study indicate that the strategy for developing Mutun Beach tourism is 1) Marketing Mutun Beach tourism on platforms, websites, and other social media so that it can develop quickly and be known by many tourists, as well as maximize existing facilities and infrastructure. 2) Recruiting human resources who are competent in their fields and optimizing existing infrastructure facilities so that they are maintained and maintained in the future. 3) Improving cleanliness and maintaining tourist attractions such as tourist attractions so that they still look beautiful and memorable for tourists to come back. 4) Tighten supervision of tourists who swim by involving residents who understand the surrounding conditions.",

      "abstract": "The Russian military invasion of Ukraine surprisingly impacted the world's geopolitical situation. The conflict that started at the end of February is ongoing, potentially disrupting economic and trade performance in the global sector, including Indonesia. The battle has the opportunity to increase some food commodity prices, thus hampering the total imports carried out. In addition, other leading commodities (non-oil and gas) such as gold, oil, and coal will also experience significant turmoil due to the conflict that has continued to heat up recently. The study provides an overview of the systemic impact on Indonesia's economic conditions by predicting the short-term possibilities. This study investigates the Russia-Ukraine conflict's initial estimate of the net import value of the two countries and other trading partners. This study uses independent variables, namely oil and gas commodities and gold prices over eleven years (2000-2021). Error Correction Model (ECM) is an analytical method used in this study. This research expects to give an overview to academia, business, industry, and the government in anticipating Indonesia's economic and trade performance to the crisis in Russia and Ukraine. Thus, it is hoped that this research can be used as an illustration of the government to make decisions in allocating import values amid the polemic between Russia and Ukraine so that trade values can be optimal.",

      "abstract": "As a result of globalization, countries in the world are required to expand the scope of their economic activities. Trade openness is critical to the globalization of international trade barriers, as tariff and non-tariff barriers diminish. Trade openness is a contributing factor to the growth of both developed and developing countries. Openness of trade can provide opportunities for each country to export goods whose factors of production use abundant resources and import goods whose production will be expensive if produced domestically. The purpose of this study is to determine trade openness, government spending and the workforce on economic growth. Eight ASEAN members were included in the sample study for the period 2015 to 2020: Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Philippines and Myanmar. In panel regression, the Fixed Effect Model is used to determine how trade openness, government spending and the labor force affect economic growth. Both labor force and trade openness variables have a positive and significant effect on economic growth, while the government spending variable has a negative and significant effect on economic growth.",

      "abstract": "Kelimpahan sumber daya alam merupakan anugerah bagi wilayah yang memilikinya. Namun\r\nterdapat paradoks yang menyebutkan bahwa kelimpahan sumber daya alam dapat berpengaruh negatif terhadap\r\npertumbuhan perekonomian, fenomena ini disebut dengan Natural Resource Curse. Beberapa penelitian telah\r\nmenemukan bahwa kelimpahan sumber daya alam dapat berpengaruh negatif terhadap pertumbuhan\r\nperekonomian. Penelitian ini akan menguji apakah fenomena Natural Resource Curse pada tingkat provinsi di\r\nPulau Sumatera dalam periode 2014-2019 dan menguji besaran nilai dariNatural Resource Curse tersebut\r\ndengan menggunakan indeks yang dinamakan Regional Resource Curse Index (RRCI) dengan dua indikator\r\nyakni, Natural Resource Curse Index (NRDI) dan RegionalSuistainable Development Index (RSDI). Penelitian\r\nmenggunakan analisis regresi data panel, dilakukan dengan cara melihat pengaruh kelimpahan sumber daya\r\nalam terhadap pertumbuhan ekonomi. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa kelimpahan sumber daya alam yang\r\nmenggunakan danabagi hasil pertambangan dan migas berpengaruh positif dan tidak signifikan berpengaruh\r\nterhadap pertumbuhan ekonomi. Hal tersebut membuktikan bahwa fenomena Natural Resource Curse tidak\r\nterjadi pada tingkat provinsi di Pulau Sumatera pada periode 2014-2019. Namun berdasarkan nilai RRCI,\r\nmenunjukkan bahwa provinsi dengan sumber daya alam tambang yang lebih kaya cenderung menghadapi\r\nfenomena Natural Resource Curse yang lebih tinggi. Hasilnya Provinsi Jambi merupakanwilayah dengan RRCI\r\ntertinggi sebesar 1,26, dengan NRDI sebesar 54,9 dan RSDI sebesar 53,9.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT\r\nThis research aims to find out the long-term and short-term effects of the oil price variable on the exchange rate, as well as the variables of foreign \r\nexchange reserves, relative money supply, relative GDP, and interest rates relative to the exchange rate in Indonesia. The analytical method used is the \r\nerror correction model (ECM). This study’s results indicate a significant adverse effect between the variables of foreign exchange reserves, relative \r\nGDP, and relative interest rates on exchange rates in the long term and short term. There is an insignificant positive relationship between oil prices \r\nand the exchange rate in the long term and a significant positive relationship in the short term. There is a negligible negative effect between the money \r\nsupply relative to the exchange rate in the long term and an essential negative relationship in the short term.\r\nKeywords: ECM, Foreign Exchange Reserves, Oil Price, Relative Money Supply, Relative GDP, Interest Rates Relative\r\nJEL Classifications: E4, F31, Q3",

On a more macro level, the banking system affects \r\nbanking performance on economic growth. Islamic banking is also stated to contribute better than conventional \r\nbanking in achieving SDG points. The primary purpose of this study is to examine the development of \r\nconventional and Islamic banks in the future for short- and long-term analysis. The analysis will discuss how \r\nproductive assets, bank profits, and third-party funds are both types of banking and how these three things \r\ncontribute to economic growth for the next five years. Research analysis will be able to provide a comparison \r\nof the application of the short and long-term performance of sharia concepts to economic growth. \r\nFurthermore, it will be seen how the contribution of the two existing periods of the term of banking to \r\neconomic growth, which one has a more significant impact on economic growth. Data was gathered for eleven \r\nyears to test these relationships and analyzed accordingly. Besides descriptive analysis, correlations, and \r\nregression, mediation analysis was carried out using Vector Autoregression (VAR). VAR is a model that can \r\nanalyze the interdependence relationship between time series variables. The results proved that profits, credits \r\nand assets significantly affect the short and long term. This study has some meaningful contributions towards \r\nboth short and long practical knowledge of the subject matter, especially for banking and Government. \r\nKey-Words: - Syariah banking, VAR, short and long-term performance, economic growth",

The objects of this research are lower-middle income countries \r\nin the Asian region during the 2000-2018 range. The method used in this research is a Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square (FMOLS). The results of \r\nthis study indicate that FDI, population, economic complexity, and energy intensity increase the amount of CO2\r\n. These results produce policies related \r\nto the environment, where the government, the private sector, and the community have the same vision to improve the quality of the environment. The \r\npolicy that can be taken is by setting strict regulations for investors so that the pollution haven hypothesis does not occur in lower-income countries \r\nin Asia. The policy was adopted by imposing a carbon tax. This policy is accompanied by reducing the birth rate, increasing innovation and economic \r\ncomplexity by paying attention to environmental sustainability, as well as carrying out energy transformation. Thus, it is expected to reduce the spread \r\nof CO2\r\n that lower-middle-income countries are ready to become upper-middle-income countries or even high-income countries.\r\nKeywords: CO2\r\n, Economic Complexity, Energy Intensity, FMOLS\r\nJEL Classifications: Q4, Q5, O1",

The Badan Pusat Statistik \r\n(BPS) of the Republic of Indonesia, PLN, the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Ministry of Public Works \r\nand Public Housing of the Republic of Indonesia, and Bank Indonesia provided data for this research. The FEM \r\n(fixed effect model) technique was used to analyse panel data from 2015 to 2019 in 10 provinces in Sumatra. \r\nEconomic growth is a temporary variable; the independent variables are roads, electricity, irrigation, and \r\neducational infrastructure. According to the findings, the variable length of provincial highways in excellent \r\nand moderate condition, electricity consumption, irrigation, and educational infrastructure in the form of school \r\nbuildings had a positive and significant influence on economic growth in Sumatra provinces from 2015 to \r\n2019. As a result, the government must provide facilities and infrastructure to boost economic growth.\r\nKey-Words: - Economic Growth, Roads, Electricity, Irrigation, Educational, Infrastructure, Sumatra",

Various groups \r\nwidely discuss corruption and economic growth from academia, government, and the private sector. This is \r\neven more complex when coupled with competitiveness between countries and democratic systems. So this \r\nstudy aims to analyze the mudhorot of corruption and the influence of global competitiveness and democracy \r\non economic growth in ASEAN countries. This study used panel data analysis methods in 7 ASEAN countries \r\nfrom 2014-2019. The seven countries are Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Laos, and \r\nCambodia. It is related to economic growth, corruption, and competitiveness in ASEAN countries. The results \r\nof this study show that corruption brings mudhorot but has yet to be significant to economic growth. Another \r\ninteresting finding is that democracy negatively affects global competitiveness and increases economic growth. \r\nThis research can be one of the government's policy recommendations by increasing economic growth through \r\nstrict enforcement against corruption and increasing global competitiveness. To realize economic growth that \r\nprospers society requires the role of the government through increasing human and institutional resources to \r\nsupport other competitiveness factors that focus on technological, environmental, and innovation aspects. \r\nKey-Words: - Corruption, Democracy, Global Competitiveness, Economic Growth",

      "abstract": "A decrease in a country's export prices and a decrease in foreign exchange reserves\r\nare indicative of exchange rate market pressures, which would be described as the\r\npresence of oversupply or disequilibrium in the money market. The method used in\r\nthis study is the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to investigate Exchange\r\nMarket Pressure (EMP) in Indonesia. The data in this study is secondary data\r\nsourced from Central Bureau of Statistics and Bank Indonesia (BI) website. The\r\nfindings of this study show a strong positive long-term relationship between\r\ndomestic credit growth and the BI rate, a large negative long-term relationship\r\nbetween GDP growth and the BI rate, and no significant relationship between the\r\ncurrent account balance and the exchange rate.",
