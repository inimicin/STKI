The research wasonducted for 60 days in lined pond of 12 m2 in size. The number of six ponds with stocking density of 200 pcs\/m2 was carried out.  The average weight of seed was 5-6 g. In culture period, cat fish wasd in ad libitum with twice feeding frequencies.  The result showed that performance of cat fish that cultivated on intensive scale with zero water exchange system were : survival rate of 70,5-88,8% with average of 81,3%, feed conversion ratio of 1,00-1,06 with average of 1,03, dayly growth rate of 1,08-1,41 g\/day with average of 1,18 g\/day, and productivity of 11,8-13 kgs\/m2.\r\nKey word : C. gariepinus, cat fish, intensive scale, zero water exchange.",
