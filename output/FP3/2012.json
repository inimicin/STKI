      "abstract": "Lead has known as toxic metal element in water environment which may come from domestic and industrial waste systems. Recent research proved that microalgae may reduce lead concentration by using bioaccumulation mechanism to the threshold level approximately. Tetraselmis is marine microalgae which has sensitive respond to heavy metal. The research aim was to determined the bioacumulation treshold effect of specific heavy metal (lead) on marine microalgae Tetraselmis sp. The research was conducted on July 2010 in BBPBL Hanura Lampung Province. The research was used two different media (TMRL and Conwy) and each treatment was added lead of 0,25 mg\/l. Data was analyzed by using simple linier regression model to found the correlation between microalgae density and present of heavy metal. The result showed that the media has not significant effect on bioaccumulation ability of Tetraselmis sp. In the other hand, the present of heavy metal on media has positive correllation to initial concentration of heavy metal on microalgae biomass (rConwy=0,657; rTMRL=0,682).",

Vaccine was produced by inactivated A. salmonicida with adding 1 ppm (v\/v) formaldehide and incubated for 24h in room temperature. Ten juvenil of carp (Vaccine was administrated in each 10 ﬁsh by injection intraperitoneally (107 cfu\/ﬁsh), orally (107 cfu\/ﬁsh), immersion (107 cfu\/ml for 30 minute) and control (ﬁsh with no vaccination). Booster was conducted 7 days after ﬁrst vaccination with same dossage and method. Titer antibody\r\nwas evaluated in three times i.e. before vaccination, 7th days after ﬁrst vaccination, and 7th days after booster. Water quality such as dissolved oxygen, pH, and water temperature was measured as a supported parameters. Results showed that titer antibodi for all treatment before vaccination was 1\/6. However, titer antibody after vaccination and booster increased to 1\/58.67 and 1\/85.33 for i.p injection, 1\/42.67 and 1\/64 for oral, 1\/24 and 42.67 for immerse, respectively. Whereas, there was no signiﬁcantly increasing of titer antibody in control that was 1\/9.33 and 1\/18.67 for vaccination and bosster, respectively. Vaccine adminsitration method by injection\r\ni.p. was the best method for obtain the best immunogenicity of vaccine. Water quality parameters along this experiment still in optimum range for common carp living.",
