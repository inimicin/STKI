      "abstract": "Onggok' is a byproduct of tapioca processing industry that potentially contaminate the environment if not managed properly. One effort to reduce it's potential of pollution is to use it as fish feed. This research aimed to study the use of fC'rmented 'onggok' as a feed ingredient that could be obtained fish feed formulations appropriate. In this research, which had been fermented 'onggok' by Aspergillus niger bacteria, added to the feed with different proportions, ie 34.3% (A); 25.73% (B); 17.2% (C); 8.57% ( D), and 0% (E). Then these fish feed formulations were tested to patin fish, Pangasius hyphopthalmus, 3 cm in length during seven weeks of treatment. This experiment was conducted with three replicates, and equipped with the controls, i.e patin fish that fed on commercial feed. The results of this research revealed that there were significant differences in tested fish's body weight gain at each treatment, and 0 treatment caused an increase of weight was among the other treatments.",

A total of 30 seahorse fry aged 30 days (D30) is maintained in an aquarium-sized container 65x40x40 cm3 for each treatment with three replications, so we need 270 seeds tail sea \r\nhorses and nine aquariums. During the research, which lasted 60 days, horses were fed Artemia sea, and shrimp Diaphanasoma snatcher (Mysids spp). The survey results revealed that the average body length increment seahorse's highest seed contained in the recirculation system of 0.49 cm, while the average length of the seed-added sea horses of the circulatory system, and stagnating, respectively, are 0.40 cm and 0.35 cm, while the average survival of seahorses have the highest seed in the recirculation system amounted to 60.37%, followed by circulatory system (52.60%) and stagnant system (36.66%)",
