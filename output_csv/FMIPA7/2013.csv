0,published,['Q1'],"One of the major reasons for the wide epidemicity of tubercu�losis and for the necessity for extensive chemotherapeutic regi�mens is that the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
has an ability to become dormant. Therefore, new lead com�pounds that are anti-bacterial against M. tuberculosis in both
active and dormant states are urgently needed. Marine sponge
diterpene alkaloids, agelasines B, C, and D, from an Indonesian
marine sponge of the genus Agelas were rediscovered as anti�dormant-mycobacterial substances. Based on the concept that
the transformants over-expressing targets of antimicrobial sub�stances confer drug resistance, strains resistant to agelasine D
were screened from Mycobacterium smegmatis transformed
with a genomic DNA library of Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Se�quence analysis of the cosmids isolated from resistant trans�formants revealed that the responsible gene was located in
the genome region between 3475.051 and 3502.901 kb. Fur�ther analysis of the transformants over-expressing the individu�al gene contained in this region indicated that BCG3185c (pos�sibly a dioxygenase) might be a target of the molecule. More�over, agelasine D was found to bind directly to recombinant BCG3185c protein (KD 2.42 mm), based on surface plasmon res�onance (SPR). This evidence strongly suggests that the BCG3185c protein is the major target of agelasine D, and that the latter is the anti-mycobacterial substance against dormant bacilli",15,"['Lampung University', 'Osaka University']",['research collaboration'],http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/32119,2013-11-14,"Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
