Therefore, the research objective i.e. to know the effect of transplanting period and media on seedling growth quality of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King.) in the nursery is important.  The research was conducted from October 1997 until February 1998 at the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Lampung.  The experimental units were arranged in 5 x 3 factorial experiment in Randomized Complete Block Design.  The first factor was transplanting period (1,2,3,4, and 5 weeks after seed germination).  The second factor was transplanting media (soil+sand, soil+sand+husk, and soil+sand+sawdust).  The analysis of variance and honestly significant difference (HSD) were used to compare the treatment effects.  The result showed that transplanting period at three weeks after seed germinated and transplanting media with soil+sand+husk were able to produce the best seedling growth quality.  The best seedling growth quality of mahogany (four months old) in this treatment was 0.0383 quality index and dry weight of 3.823 gram per seedling.
