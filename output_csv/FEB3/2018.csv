Counterproductive Work Behavior (CWB). The sample was 115 employees of Islamic financial
institutions in Lampung, Indonesia. The analysis shows that IWE has a negative effect on CWB,
EC also has a negative effect on CWB. This finding shows that CWB can be reduced by IWE and EC.
EC influence is slightly higher than IWE shows that although IWE plays a good role in reducing
CWB, the role of the ethical climate in the organization has slightly greater in reducing CWB",http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/12147,2018-12-01,"[{'name': {'given': 'Keumala', 'honourific': None, 'family': 'Hayati', 'lineage': None}, 'id': 'umi_asra@yahoo.co.id'}, {'id': 'igoc4n@gmail.com', 'name': {'given': 'Indra', 'honourific': None, 'lineage': None, 'family': 'Caniago'}}, {'id': 'yuningsihnangwie@yahoo.com', 'name': {'family': 'Yuningsih', 'lineage': None, 'honourific': None, 'given': 'Yuningsih'}}]",article,TRUE,"Can Islamic Work Ethics and Ethical Climate

companies listed on the stock exchange in three developing countries, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, and
Thailand, before and after 2007. In 2007 chosen as the cut-off year of observation as we find in each country
was issued a significant environmental policy. By doing a differential test on a sample of 24.626 independent
firms/years, the study found that four variables used in this study overall showed a significant difference.
Environmental costs, the disclosure of environmental, social disclosure, and ESG that observed in three
developing countries has increased significantly after 2007. However, we did not find a significant increase
in environmental costs in Indonesia. The findings of this study indicate that the theory of regulation,
particularly for public interest theory, can explain clearly the reasons why the four variables research has
increased after the environmental regulations issued.
