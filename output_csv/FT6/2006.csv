This research used anaerobic process of upflow sludge blanket (UASB) in order to reduce the COD content of the tapioca wastewater originated from a community based tapioca starch industry.  The results showed that reduction of COD could be as high as 90%.  This process required 2 (two) weeks to start-up.  During the continous process, the maximum condition of the COD reduction and gas production was achieved at pH of 5.2, TSS 1340 mg/L, OLR 45 kg COD/m3 and 6 hours of liquid resident time.  Control of pH influent between 5.0-6.5 could be carried-out to sabilise the COD reduction, however, its effect was not high.",http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/715,2006-09-01,PROSIDING HEDS Seminar on Science and Technology 2006 Bidang Ilmu Teknik,['TP'],published
