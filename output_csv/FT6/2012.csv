0,published,The 3rd International Conference on Environmental Research and Technology 2012,['TP'],"Since distomers of racemic drugs are frequently not used to heal diseases, utilization of single enantiomeric drugs not only decreases the drugs dosages and side effects but also reduces eco-toxicological problem.  Since enzymatic membrane reactors (EMR) can be run continuously, observation on free-enzyme catalysis as a preliminary study before development of the EMR is needed.  This paper describes acetylation of the racemic atenolol enzymatically using free lipases.  The atenolol enantiomers reacted with vinyl acetate in water miscible organic compounds and phosphate buffer solutions.  High conversions were obtained once the reactions were conducted in the organic media using PFL (XR: 84.22%, XS: 91.78%), Lipoprotein 62336 (XR: 100%; XS: 100%) and CALB (XR: 77%, XS: 51.82%).  Reactions in PO4 buffers produced low conversions.  It seems the KR process was difficult to be developed through the acetylation pathway.  During observations on the AT enantiomers’ concentrations, the analytical protocols produced excellent selectivities.  The highest selectivity was given by the slowest flow rate, which developed higher enantiomeric peak areas.",1970-01-01 00:00:00.000002012,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/714,['FT6'],disk0/00/00/07/14,conference,public,2016-10-04 01:12:48,10,pub,2016-10-04 01:12:48,archive,714,show,91-96,390,https://icert.usm.my/index.php/en/gallery/icert-2012,2016-10-04 01:12:48,"[{'format': 'text', 'files': [{'datasetid': 'document', 'fileid': 4075, 'hash': 'ac4819862268cf8177c4ffdfb7c3e8bf', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'objectid': 612, 'filesize': 1752855, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/file/4075', 'filename': '07 Proceeding Internasional ICERT 2012.pdf', 'hash_type': 'MD5', 'mtime': '2016-10-03 14:05:47'}], 'main': '07 Proceeding Internasional ICERT 2012.pdf', 'docid': 612, 'content': 'published', 'language': 'en', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'rev_number': 2, 'eprintid': 714, 'placement': 1, 'security': 'public', 'pos': 1, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/612'}]",speech,conference_item,"[{'name': {'honourific': None, 'lineage': None, 'family': 'Agustian', 'given': 'Joni'}, 'id': 'joni.agustian@eng.unila.ac.id'}, {'id': None, 'name': {'honourific': None, 'lineage': None, 'family': 'Harun@Kamaruddin', 'given': 'Azlina'}}]",Free lipase-based enzymatic acetylation of racemic atenolol: A preliminary kinetic resolution study,30 May - 1 June 2012,TRUE,"Park Royal Hotel, Penang, Malaysia",,,,,,,,,,
1,published,,['TP'],"Because chiral liquid chromatography (LC) could become a powerful tool to
estimate racemic atenolol quantity, excellent enantiomeric separation should be produced during
data acquisition for satisfactory observation of atenolol concentrations throughout the racemic
resolution processes. Selection of chiral LC column and analytical protocol that fulfill demands of
the ultra fast LC analysis is essential. This article describes the characteristics of atenolol chromatographic
separation that resulted fromdifferent resolution media and analytical protocols with the use
of a ChiralcelW OD column. The chromatograms showed quite different characteristics of the
separation process. The single enantiomer and racemic atenolol could be recognized by the
ChiralcelW OD column in less than 20 min. Symmetrical peaks were obtained; however, several
protocols produced peaks with wide bases and slanted baselines. Observations showed that efficient
enantioresolution of racemic atenolol was obtained at slow mobile phase flow rate, decreased concentration
of amine-type modifier but increased alcohol content in mobile phase and highest ultraviolet
detection wavelength were required. The optimal ultra fast LC protocol enables to reduce and eliminate
the peaks of either the atenolol solvent or the buffers and provided the highest peak intensities
of both atenolol enantiomers.",2012-05-01 00:00:00.000000000,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/711,['FT6'],disk0/00/00/07/11,,public,2016-10-04 01:12:30,6,pub,2016-10-04 01:12:30,archive,711,show,356-367,390,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1520-636X,2016-10-04 01:12:30,"[{'main': '03 Jurnal Internasional Chirality 2012.pdf', 'files': [{'mtime': '2016-10-03 09:20:19', 'hash_type': 'MD5', 'filename': '03 Jurnal Internasional Chirality 2012.pdf', 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/file/4055', 'objectid': 608, 'filesize': 855443, 'hash': '7b56daa74ae1f8028de953653378b13f', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'fileid': 4055, 'datasetid': 'document'}], 'docid': 608, 'format': 'text', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'language': 'en', 'rev_number': 1, 'placement': 1, 'eprintid': 711, 'pos': 1, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/608', 'security': 'public'}]",,article,"[{'name': {'honourific': None, 'family': 'Agustian', 'lineage': None, 'given': 'Joni'}, 'id': 'joni.agustian@eng.unila.ac.id'}, {'id': None, 'name': {'lineage': None, 'family': 'Harun@Kamaruddin', 'honourific': None, 'given': 'Azlina'}}, {'id': None, 'name': {'lineage': None, 'family': 'Aboul-Enein', 'honourific': None, 'given': 'Hassan'}}]","Chromatographic Comparison of Atenolol Separation in Reaction

prominent differences in the hydrolytic degradation process of rice bran and wood flour filled biocomposites. The water uptake and mass loss for polylactide/wood flour composites were similar to that

increased wood flour concentration in the remaining biocomposite matrices. In contrast, the polylactide/
rice bran composites exhibited larger water uptake and higher mass loss. Pyrolysis-GC-MS and FTIR

addition of kaolin resulted in materials with intermediate tensile strength and strain at break values. The addition of milled wood

Konsentrasi etanol tertinggi diperoleh pada temperatur 30 C, kecepatan pengadukan 0 rpm dan konsentrasi substrat 32 g/l, yield 70,7%, laju pembentukan produk (qp) 4,07689.jam dan laju pertumbuhan spesifik maksimum 0,02199/jam",2012-11-28 00:00:00.000000000,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/49978,['FT6'],disk0_bak/00/04/99/78,,public,2023-04-10 00:58:07,6,pub,2023-04-10 00:58:07,archive,49978,show,330-340,336,,2023-04-10 00:58:07,"[{'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'language': 'en', 'rev_number': 1, 'docid': 189667, 'main': 'Ao.pdf', 'files': [{'filesize': 3183975, 'objectid': 189667, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/file/540858', 'filename': 'Ao.pdf', 'hash_type': 'MD5', 'mtime': '2023-04-09 10:29:01', 'datasetid': 'document', 'fileid': 540858, 'hash': 'ecbf25ba36938a4d0397df03376ec715', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf'}], 'format': 'text', 'pos': 1, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/189667', 'security': 'public', 'placement': 1, 'eprintid': 49978}]",,article,"[{'name': {'given': 'Panca', 'lineage': None, 'family': 'Panca Nugrahini F', 'honourific': None}, 'id': 'pancanugrahini@gmail.com'}, {'name': {'honourific': None, 'lineage': None, 'family': 'Qori Nasrul Ulum', 'given': 'Qori'}, 'id': 'orynas@gmail.com'}]",Fenomena Variasi Konsentrasi Substrat dan Kecepatan Pengadukan pada Fermentasi Etanol dari Limbah Cair Hasil Pengepresan Kulita Nenas Menggunakan Schizosaccharomyces pombe,,TRUE,,Universitas Sriwijaya,Seminar Nasional AVoER,,979-587-440-3,4.0,,4.0,,,
9,published,,['TP'],"Minyak terpentin Indonesia mengandung 65-85 % α-pinene, kurang 1% camphene, 1-3% β-pinene, 10-18 % 3-carene dan limonene 1-3%.  α-Pinene dapat dihidrasi dengan larutan asam menghasilkan  α-terpineol. Produk α-terpineol ini dapat digunakan untuk  bahan pelarut, parfum, disinfektan, dll. 
Penelitian ini bertujuan mempelajari parameter-parameter yang berpengaruh pada sintesis α-terpineol dari  terpentin dengan katalisator asam khloro asetat. α-Pinene (terpentin) sebanyak 0,25 mol, aquadest sebanyak 0,6 mol dan katalisator asam khloro asetat  dengan konsentrasi 6 M direaksikan dalam reaktor batch yang dilengkapi dengan pendingin balik, thermometer dan pengaduk. Parameter-parameternya adalah pengaruh suhu (60, 70, 80, 90oC), pengaruh konsentrasi katalisator asam khloro asetat (3,6,9 M), pengaruh perbandingan  mol katalisator asam khloro asetat terhadap α-pinene (0,8/1; 1,6/1; 2,4/1; 3,2/1; 4/1) dan kecepatan pengadukan (264, 546 dan 954 rpm). 
Dari hasil penelitian ini disarankan kondisi operasi hidrasi terpentin yang paling baik adalah  dicapai pada suhu 80oC, konsentrasi katalisator asam khloro asetat  6 M, perbandingan  mol katalisator asam khloro asetat terhadap α-pinene 2,4/1, pengadukan dijalankan pada kecepatan  546 rpm, dan  waktu reaksi 240 menit. Konversi hidrasi terpentin menjadi α-terpineol yang diperoleh adalah 54,13%.",2012-02-01 00:00:00.000000000,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/6584,['FT6'],disk0/00/00/65/84,,public,2018-04-25 08:27:14,7,pub,2018-04-25 08:27:14,archive,6584,show,27-31,423,http://www.fti.its.ac.id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=118&Itemid=121,2018-04-25 08:27:14,"[{'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/19535', 'pos': 1, 'security': 'public', 'placement': 1, 'eprintid': 6584, 'language': 'en', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'rev_number': 1, 'files': [{'datasetid': 'document', 'fileid': 60765, 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'hash': '3032cf45f0c9a15a880f6f89e75f8663', 'filesize': 5331702, 'objectid': 19535, 'filename': 'Paper Herti Jurnal Sains ITS.pdf', 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/file/60765', 'hash_type': 'MD5', 'mtime': '2018-03-11 06:10:20'}], 'main': 'Paper Herti Jurnal Sains ITS.pdf', 'docid': 19535, 'format': 'text'}]",,article,"[{'name': {'given': 'Herti', 'honourific': None, 'lineage': None, 'family': 'Utami'}, 'id': 'herti.utami@eng.unila.ac.id'}, {'id': None, 'name': {'family': 'Sutijan', 'lineage': None, 'honourific': None, 'given': 'Sutijan'}}, {'id': None, 'name': {'given': 'Roto', 'honourific': None, 'lineage': None, 'family': 'Roto'}}, {'id': None, 'name': {'honourific': None, 'lineage': None, 'family': 'Sediawan', 'given': 'Wahyudi Budi'}}]",Sintesis α-Terpineol  dari  Terpentin  dengan Katalisator Asam Khloro  Asetat Secara Batch,,TRUE,,Institut Teknologi Surabaya,Jurnal Ilmiah Sains dan Teknologi,,1693-0533,11.0,Terakreditasi SK No. 83/DIKTI/Kep/2009,1.0,,,"['Jurusan Teknik Kimia, Universitas Lampung, Bandar Lampung', 'Jurusan Teknik Kimia, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta', 'Jurusan MIPA Kimia, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta', 'Jurusan Teknik Kimia, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta']"
