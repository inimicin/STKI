This study attempted to explore what learning strategies language Indonesian learners used and how the strategies were
classified. To increase the internal consistency of the hypothesized scales, Cronbach Alpha coefficients of internal consistency were computed for each scale of skill-based areas, namely: speaking, listening, reading and writing. Correlation analysis was also conducted to see how variance of speaking, listening, reading and writing in language learning strategy questionnaire were correlated. The result shows that each skill-based scale
has relatively high reliability with alpha .73, .67, 69, .80 for listening, speaking, reading and writing respectively. It is also found out that the four
scales are significantly and positively correlated. The classification of learning strategies based on the language skills is a new way of learning strategy measurement, which may be worth considering in the Indonesian context in which English is learned as a foreign language",http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/1689,2004,['LB'],published
