This
current research aims to intently find out the significant difference in the speaking achievement of the students who are taught
through the modified think-pair-share based on suggestopedia and those who are taught through the original think-pair-share. This
is a quasi-experimental research design that conducts a quantitative method. Subjects of this research are two classes of SMK N 3
Bandar Lampung. The finding shows that there is a significant difference in the increase of the score of experimental and control
class after the students are taught through the methods. The t-value is 2.687 at the significant level of 0.009 which is lower than
0.05. Hence, it is concluded that applying the method of the modified think-pair-share based on suggestopedia principles can increase
the students’ speaking achievement.

In fact, the students face some
difficulties in writing due to some factors. Therefore, the aims of this study were 1) to find out whether guided
writing using color code and guided question technique in teaching writing significantly enhances students’
writing ability, 2) to find out the aspects of writing ability enhanced the most significantly. The design was pre-
experimental with One Group Pre-Test and Post-Test Design. The subjects of this research were 25 students of
tenth-grade students of SMAN 1 Kibang East Lampung-Indonesia. The writing test was administered to collect
the data. The results show that there is a significant difference between the students’ writing abilities after the
implementation of The Guided Writing Technique. It is revealed from the mean score of pre-test which is 53.8 and
the mean score of post-test which is 67.9. In addition, from the sig.2 tailed, it shows that the significant level is
0.000. It means that the significant level is below 0.05. for the improvement of each aspect of writing ability. The
results shows that all sig. (2-tailed) value for each aspect is < 0.05 (0.000, 0.000, 0.002, and 0.000) except for
mechanics (0.198). It means that all writing aspects assessed by the researcher enhanced significantly from the
pre-test to the post-test. then language use is the aspect of writing enhanced most. In conclusion, guided writing
is an appropriate technique to enhance students’ writing ability.
