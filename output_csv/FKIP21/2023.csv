questionnaire, then analyzed by using descriptive analysis. The questionnaires were 
distributed to 14 Science teacher respondents and 127 junior high school students in 
North Metro District. The result shows that teacher have a positive perception toward 
usage of the electronic students' worksheets based on chiken manure waste treatment 
projects. The results showed that 79% of teachers had not used project-based e�worksheets; based on students' response questionnaires, 37% of teachers have given 
project assignments, but the projects were not based on real problems in the 
environment. Environmental problems that occur in North Metro District is the amount 
of chicken manure waste issue that causes pollution to the environment around society’s
