transformation process from agricultural economy to industrial economy, is followed by
environmental degradation such as deforestation, deterioration of air quality and micro-climate.
Besides, it is also acompanied by the change in family behavior in relation to their adaptaion
which also leads to the prevalence of various diseases including Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever
(DHF). These phenomena are being experienced by many villages in South Lampung Regency
especially in the suburban area of the capital city, Bandar Lampung. This research aims to
investigate the influence of environmental factors, sex, the age of toddlers and the family’s habit
on toddlers’ immunity against DHF. The research was conducted from July to October 2016 in
South Lampung Regency especially in the 7 districts with a relatively high number of DHF cases
on toddlers namely Natar Agung Jati, Bakauheni, Ketapang, Tanjung Sari, Sidomulyo, and
Katibung. The data analysis was conducted at the Forest Resource Inventory Laboratory,
Faculty of Agriculture, The University of Lampung, Indonesia. The macro environmental
variables investigated are the level of regional urbanism, the amplitude (maximum-minimum)
of air temperature [TEMP_AM], average rainfall [RAIN], forest and agroforestry acreage
[RTH_AGRF] as well as fishpond and other water bodies such as dyke, pond, retention basin
and the like [RTH_POND]. The [RTH_AGRF] and [RTH_POND] data are provided through
the record of Landsat satellite image interpretation that recorded on June 21, 2016, on
path123/row 064 segment followed by field validation. The climate data are obtained from the
Board of Climatology, Meteorology and Geophysics of Lampung especially from Branti,
Panjang and Bakauheni Stations. Case data on toddlers who have been medical tested as positive
for DHF on the basis of laboratory tests for the period of January 2015 to June 2016 were
obtained from Health Department of South Lampung. Each case was surveyed to conduct
observation on the family’s habit. The same observation was also conducted on 1 –3 families
with uninfected (immune) toddlers who lived around the case location. To test the hypothesis,
the log-linear model postulate is used, whose the resistant toddlers are scored by Y=1 and the
affected ones are scored by Y=0. Optimization of 15 model parameters was done with Minitab
17 software at 15% of the real level. The conclusions of the variables that significantly influence
are air temperature amplitude (every increase of 10
C the resistance decreased to 1/1000); the
area of green open space (each 1,000 ha reforestation, the resistance increased 25.05 times); the area of fishponds and ponds (every increase of 1,000 ha, the resistance increased 24.03 times),
toddlers’ sex (male is 2.21 times more resistant than female); inner family’s habits: (a) using
mosquitoes repellent, (b) cultivating fish, and (c) not hanging clothes where the toddlers of those
who have mentioned habits are more resitant consecutively 11:48; 2.95; and 10.62 times than
those who do not do the habits. It is suggested that to conduct research in other regencies as
well as integrate the nutritional status and another disease history before the toddlers are affected
by dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).",published,"['GE', 'RA0421']",,,,,,,,,

This characteristics resulted in the low ability of the soil to carry electrons. For this reason, it is necessary to additive treatment to the soil which will be used as grounding media. This research aims to compare the effect of soil resistance decrease between soil mixing with bentonite, lime and building waste debris. The direct measurements were conducted by using Earth Ground Resistance Tester tool. It can be concluded that the addition of additives has an effect on the decrease of grounding resistance value. The best response to the decrease in resistance consecutively was in the mixture of soil with debris, then followed by soil with lime and soil with bentonite. This finding was prospective for the development of artificial grounding media to reduce the risk of lightning hazards in dense residential areas while reducing the burden and

The increasing demands of various human needs have resulted in the exploitation of natural resources and forced changes in land use for settlements, agriculture areas and industry which ultimately lead to environmental damage. On the other hand, the world is currently facing climate change, a
phenomenon that is characterized by a notable increase in air temperatures and fluctuations in
rainfalls. Climate change could interfere with the environmental state so that it affects the
resistance of the majority of living things in the world, both humans and animals to climatebased disease infections such as Avian Influenza (AI). The purpose of this study (1) is to build a causal relationship between climate change and land cover on the incidence of AI in livestock poultry sector 4 in Lampung Province and (2) to determine the impact of climate change and land cover on the incidence of AI in poultry in sector 4 livestock in the Lampung province.

This research used factorial completely random design with two treatments and each treatment was repeated three times. The first treatment was by seeing differences of fertilizer combination administrations between agricultural fertilizer (Urea 40 ppm, Za 20 ppm and TSP 5 ppm) and Conwy fertilizer 1 ml/L. The second treatment was paste making by administering different NaOH doses (100 ppm, 125 ppm, 150 ppm and 175 ppm). Data were analyzed by using analysis of variance (ANOVA), and whenever any significant difference result was obtained, then Least Significant Different test with α = 0.05 was conducted.
