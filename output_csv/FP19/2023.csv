sensory properties of ice cream with the addition of yellow sweet potato and to determine the best type of
stabilizer that produces ice cream with good physical and sensory properties. The study was arranged in a
completely randomized design (CRD) with a single factor and four replications. The single factor treatment
was a stabilizer type with 6 levels, that is 0.5% CMC (P1), 0.5% sodium alginate (P2), 0.5% carrageenan
(P3), 0.5% arabic gum (P4), 0.5% gelatin  (P5), and 0.5% pectin (P6). The results showed that the use of
various types of stabilizers for ice cream with the addition of yellow sweet potato had a significant effect on
overrun, texture, color, and overall acceptance, but did not significantly affect the melting speed and stability
of the ice cream emulsion. The best type of stabilizer for ice cream with the addition of yellow sweet potato is
0.5% gelatin (P5) with an overrun value (52.95%), emulsion stability (86.82%), melting speed (27.00
minutes), texture score 4.31 (soft), color score 2.73 (yellowish white), and overall acceptance score 4.44
(like). Yellow sweet potato ice cream with the addition of 0.5% gelatin stabilizer contains fat content
(22.18%), protein content (6.29%), total solids content (37.36%), crude fiber content (0.67% ), and
antioxidant activity (752.32 g/mL).

The influence of inoculum types on the chemical characteristics and β�glucan content of tempe gembus. Biodiversitas 24: 793-798. Tempe gembus is a type of tempe which is made by fermenting tofu dregs with Rhizopus oligosporus. Tempe gembus has lower nutritional value than soybean tempe. Adding Saccharomyces cerevisiae to manufacture tempe gembus is expected to increase the added value of tempe gembus. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of various types of inoculums on the chemical properties and β-glucan content of tempe gembus. The study used a completely
randomized block design (RBD) with 3 repetitions and 7 types of inoculums: commercial tempe inoculum (RAPRIMA) (T1), S. 
cerevisiae (T2), R. oligosporus (T3), commercial tempe inoculum (RAPRIMA) + commercial yeast (Fermipan) (T4), commercial tempe inoculum (RAPRIMA) + S. cerevisiae (T5), R. oligosporus + Fermipan (T6), and R. oligosporus + S. cerevisiae (T7). Tempe gembus produced was analyzed for the content of fat, protein, ash, water, carbohydrates, and β-glucan. The data obtained was analyzed statistically using one way ANOVA and the Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test. The results showed that the type of tempe inoculum increased the levels of protein, ash, water and β-glucan but decreased the levels of fat and carbohydrates in tempe gembus. A mixture of R. oligosporus and S. cerevisiae produced the best tempe gembus containing 0.69% β-glucan, 6.98% protein, 0.48% ash, 83.98% water, 8.12% carbohydrates and 0.47% fat.",24.0,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/49005,2023-02-01 00:00:00.000000000,published,['QR'],"[{'id': 'samsul.rizal@fp.unila.ac.id', 'name': {'given': 'Samsul', 'family': 'Rizal', 'lineage': None, 'honourific': None}}, {'id': 'maria.erna@fp.unila.ac.id', 'name': {'honourific': None, 'family': 'Kustyawati', 'lineage': None, 'given': 'Maria Erna'}}, {'id': 'murhadiburcik@gmail.com', 'name': {'given': 'Murhadi', 'lineage': None, 'family': 'Murhadi', 'honourific': None}}]",article,The ifluence of inoculum types on the chemical characteristics and β-glucan content of tempe Gembus,TRUE,962,2.0,https://smujo.id/biodiv/article/view/13184,2023-03-20 02:02:40,"[{'format': 'text', 'main': '13184-Feb 2023-Biodiversitas-Influence of inoculum type on tempe gembus.pdf', 'files': [{'objectid': 188456, 'filesize': 494241, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/file/533066', 'filename': '13184-Feb 2023-Biodiversitas-Influence of inoculum type on tempe gembus.pdf', 'hash_type': 'MD5', 'mtime': '2023-03-18 00:37:24', 'fileid': 533066, 'datasetid': 'document', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'hash': '618086b023a2a6d89fbaa5ad73b3ccd8'}], 'docid': 188456, 'language': 'en', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'rev_number': 1, 'eprintid': 49005, 'placement': 1, 'security': 'public', 'pos': 1, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/188456'}]",2023-03-20 02:02:40,archive,49005,show,793-798,,,"AOAC. 2016.

The influence of inoculum types on the chemical characteristics and β-glucan content of tempe gembus. Biodiversitas 24: 793-798. Tempe gembus is a type of tempe which is made by fermenting tofu dregs with Rhizopus oligosporus. Tempe gembus has lower nutritional value than soybean tempe. Adding Saccharomyces cerevisiae to manufacture tempe gembus is expected to increase the added value of tempe gembus. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of various types of inoculums on the chemical properties and β-glucan content of tempe gembus. The study used a completely randomized block design (RBD) with 3 repetitions and 7 types of inoculums: commercial tempe inoculum (RAPRIMA) (T1), S. cerevisiae (T2), R. oligosporus (T3), commercial tempe inoculum (RAPRIMA) + commercial yeast (Fermipan) (T4), commercial tempe inoculum (RAPRIMA) + S. cerevisiae (T5), R. oligosporus + Fermipan (T6), and R. oligosporus + S. cerevisiae (T7). Tempe gembus produced was analyzed for the content of fat, protein, ash, water, carbohydrates, and β-glucan. The data obtained was analyzed statistically using one way ANOVA and the Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test. The results showed that the type of tempe inoculum increased the levels of protein, ash, water and β-glucan but decreased the levels of fat and carbohydrates in tempe gembus. A mixture of R. oligosporus and S. cerevisiae produced the best tempe gembus containing 0.69% β-glucan, 6.98% protein, 0.48% ash, 83.98% water, 8.12% carbohydrates and 0.47% fat.",24.0,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/49004,2023-02-01 00:00:00.000000000,published,['QR'],"[{'id': 'samsul.rizal@fp.unila.ac.id', 'name': {'family': 'Rizal', 'lineage': None, 'honourific': None, 'given': 'Samsul'}}, {'id': 'maria.erna@fp.unila.ac.id', 'name': {'family': 'Kustyawati', 'lineage': None, 'honourific': None, 'given': 'Maria Erna'}}, {'name': {'honourific': None, 'family': 'Murhadi', 'lineage': None, 'given': 'Murhadi'}, 'id': 'murhadiburcik@gmail.com'}]",article,The influence of inoculum types on the chemical characteristics and β-glucan content of tempe gembus,TRUE,962,2.0,,2023-03-20 02:02:47,"[{'rev_number': 1, 'language': 'en', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'format': 'text', 'main': '13184-Feb 2023-Biodiversitas-Influence of inoculum type on tempe gembus.pdf', 'files': [{'hash': '618086b023a2a6d89fbaa5ad73b3ccd8', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'fileid': 533060, 'datasetid': 'document', 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/file/533060', 'filename': '13184-Feb 2023-Biodiversitas-Influence of inoculum type on tempe gembus.pdf', 'objectid': 188455, 'filesize': 494241, 'mtime': '2023-03-18 00:26:11', 'hash_type': 'MD5'}], 'docid': 188455, 'security': 'public', 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/188455', 'pos': 1, 'eprintid': 49004, 'placement': 1}]",2023-03-20 02:02:47,archive,49004,show,793-798,,,"AOAC. 2016.

Previously, premium tempeh starter was made in the form of liquid culture. This study aims to produce premium tempeh starter in powder form with the best type of substrate and incubation time so that it can be used practically. In this study, the effect of substrate type and incubation time on microbial viability of instant premium tempeh starter was studied. The study was arranged in a Completely Randomized Block Design with two factors and three replications. The first factor was the type of substrate: tapioca flour and rice flour, while the second factor was the incubation time at room temperature: 0, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours. The instant premium tempeh starter was analyzed for pH value, water content, number of fungi, yeast and bacteria. The microbial viability of tempeh starter was indicated by the growth of fungi, yeast and bacteria during incubation. The data obtained were analyzed by analysis of variance and further tested with the Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test at a 5% significance level. The results showed that rice flour and incubation time of 96 hours produced the best premium tempeh instant starter with the number of fungi of 9.02 Log CFU/g, 9.17 Log CFU/g yeast, 7.81 Log CFU/g bacteria, pH 4.2 and 7.75% water content.

such as starch and flour, was applied in various food
products. Therefore, this research investigated the
processing techniques of cassava starch and flour, each
with the aim of extracting the superior properties and
characteristics for a specific end product. By modifying the
existing procedures with integrated cassava processing
technology, the production of both products could occur
simultaneously. This was renewal processing as unified
technology, which implied that one single processing could
generate two products at a time. In addition to producing a 
superior characteristic, the integrated method also saved
time and cost. In this research, two factors of Completely
Randomized Design (CRD) were used in three replications.
The first factor was soaking in the flowing
water/continuous system (P1) and static water/batch
system (P2). The second was the fermentation time (T) of
24 hours (T1), 48 hours (T2), and 72 hours (T3).
Furthermore, the steps conducted include weighing, brown
and white skin peeling, washing, size reduction, immersion
in continuous and batch systems, fermentation for 24, 48,
and 72 hours, refining/milling, and starch extraction,
followed by the pressing process. The existing slurry was
deposited for 8 hours, then the starch was extracted. The 
starch and flour were dried in the oven at 60o
C until
reaching a maximum moisture content of 13%. They were
milled and sifted in a 100-mesh sieve. The results showed
that the spontaneous fermentation process in the integrated
cassava technology produces the superior characteristics of
modified cassava starch and flour to the point of being
recommended as a model. The yield whiteness value, and
swelling power (g/g) of modified cassava starch and flour
range from 9.0-12.5% and 30.58-35.44%, 91.34-94.04, and
90.41-91.56, as well as 13.28-14.35 and 14.43-17.44 (w/w),
respectively. The amylograph characteristics of the starch
paste included longer fermentation, increasing pasting
temperature, increasing maximum viscosity (value > 600),
decreasing breakdown, and increasing setback value.
Meanwhile, for flour paste, it includes longer fermentation,
increasing pasting temperature, decreasing peak viscosity

improve its utilization in composite flour. This research was carried out to evaluate the 
pasting properties of composite fermented sweet potato flour and the quality of composite 
salted noodles using those composite flour. Sweet potato slices were fermented using five 
different starters (spontaneous, Lactobacillus plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, a 
mix of Lactobacillus plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and a mix of
Lactobacillus plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), 
and processed into flour. Native sweet potato flour without fermentation was also 
prepared as a control. A total of six sweet potato flour (SPF) were then used to substitute 
50% of the wheat flour in composite white salted noodles. Then, the pasting properties of 
the composite flour and the quality of the noodles were evaluated. Results proved that 
composite fermented SPF had higher pasting properties (peak and final viscosity, break 
down, and set back value) than those of composite non-fermented SPF. The substitution 
for fermented SPF in composite white salted noodles decreased cooking loss, cooking 
time, solid loss, soluble loss, swelling index, adhesiveness, and water absorption, while 
cohesiveness, elasticity, elongation, and colour brightness increased significantly. 
Therefore, the incorporation of fermented SPF enhanced the quality of composite white 
salted noodles.",7.0,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/49418,2023-02-01 00:00:00.000000000,published,['S1'],"[{'id': 'neti.yuliana@fp.unila.ac.id', 'name': {'given': 'Neti', 'family': 'Yuliana', 'lineage': None, 'honourific': None}}, {'name': {'given': 'Siti', 'honourific': None, 'lineage': None, 'family': 'Nurdjanah'}, 'id': 'siti.nurdjanah@fp.unila.ac.id'}, {'id': 'setyani57@gmail.com', 'name': {'given': 'Sri', 'honourific': None, 'lineage': None, 'family': 'Setyani'}}, {'name': {'family': 'Novianti', 'lineage': None, 'honourific': None, 'given': 'Dini'}, 'id': None}]",article,"he benefits of fermentation in improving the pasting properties of composite

characteristics of fluidized cassava starch treated in a sedimentation tank were 
examined. Tapioka, aci puter, and elot are three types of casava starch 
products that were made from starch slurry collected at various periods of 
spontaneous fermentation. By different spontaneous fermentation time, the 
appearance of granules was significantly changed. Besides, there was 
different response color to iodine test indicating a different amylopectin 
chain-length distribution pattern. Among them, there were significant
differences in moisture content, swelling power, water absorption ratio, gel 
formation ability and pH value. These studies showed that spontaneous
