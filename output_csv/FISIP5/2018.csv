This model is created from the weaknesses of the conventional Community Based Tourism (CBT) model through the role of 3 CBT sectors (government, private, non-profit organizations) that often run independently, sporadic, non-continuous coordination, and local community involvement which often overlooked in tourism of its own territory. The implications are seen in the economic success enjoyed only by people from outside the region.
