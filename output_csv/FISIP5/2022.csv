The research sample uses 31 companies through purposive sampling. The research analysis tool uses SmartPLS 3.0. Based on the results of the analysis, the path coefficient of stock price fluctuations with company value shows that there is an effect of stock price fluctuations on company value. The path coefficient of stock price fluctuations with earnings management shows that there is an effect of stock price fluctuations on earning management. Meanwhile, the coefficient of earning management path with company value, there is no effect of earning management on company value. It also occurs in the path coefficient of earning management as a mediation of stock price fluctuations on company value. The analysis shows that there is no effect of earning management as a mediation of stock price fluctuations on company value. This is supported by the results of testing the third hypothesis which makes earning management as a mediation a negative effect on company value. However, because the results of testing the second hypothesis have an effect on stock price fluctuations on earning management, it can be concluded that earnings management only mediates a small part of stock price fluctuations on company value, although there is no effect of earning management as a mediator.

Many governments around the globe have applied electronic government, including Indonesia. 
Although there is various research on the electronic government in Indonesia, only a few studies 
have focused on analyzing the intention to use government websites, particularly the local 
government's website. To address the research gap, this paper intends to statistically examine the 
intention to use Depok City's website based on the user's perspective by applying structural 
equation modelling. This study was carried out using a survey approach. Data were collected 
using an online questionnaire on the Depok's citizens. One hundred twenty-five respondents 
participated in this study. Data were analyzed using covariance-based structural equation 
modelling. The key findings of this research confirm all developed hypotheses in which system

New Order era between 1968 and 1998, there was a great deal of tension between the local activists
represented by GAM and the Indonesian Central Government under Suharto’s regime. This prolonged
conflict occurred as a result of both groups having different perspectives on particular issues such as
the implementation of Sharia law and the distribution of natural resources between the local and
central governments. Under Suharto, the Indonesian Government believed that GAM was an
insurgency movement that aimed to separate Aceh from Indonesia. Conversely, GAM felt that the
