However, irrigation systems in many developing countries suffer from low performance, which eventually
adversely affects their sustainability.
To gain a more in-depth understanding of performance and sustainability in existing Indonesian irrigation
systems, a set of assessment was conducted. This incorporated methods of Rapid Appraisal Process and Benchmarking,
an opinion survey, and an asset survey. A triple-bottom line (TBL) sustainability assessment was also
conducted to determine the levels of sustainability and performance shortfall, as well as their causes. Based on
the results, a set of physical and managerial changes were proposed to improve irrigation system performance
and sustainability. The viability of the proposed changes was assessed further through a stakeholder’s opinion
survey and against three key sustainability issues of a TBL sustainability indicator framework: technical and
economic, social, institutional and legal issue, and environmental, public health and safety. The purpose was to
fi nd an alternative and robust solution that was also preferred by stakeholders.
Eventually, a simplifi ed asset management planning (AMP) model was developed, which would enable
water user associations to implement independently and easily. The AMP, consisting of budget planning and
short-term planning, was also based on the robust preferred priorities of improving irrigation performance and
sustainability."
