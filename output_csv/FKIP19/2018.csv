educational character in the affective domain. To do so, we engaged in research using quasi-
experimental methods. A random sample of 40 students was chosen. Data were collected 
using a questionnaire on students’ character consisting of three aspects: reasoning, feeling, 
and behavior. The data have a normal distribution with a significant value of 0.966 and 
are homogeneous with a significant value of 0.100 > 0.05. The data were analyzed using 
a paired sample

using the scientific method, was higher than ever with a significance of 0.000 < 0.05. The 
character of students in the affective domain was influenced by the feelings aspect resulting 
from the scientific method. Thus, using the scientific method in educational interventions 
improved the character of fifth-grade elementary school students.
