effectiveness of the authentic assessment model, to be developed, about the students'
achievement, interest, attitude, and learning styles of Physics. This research was a Research
and Development (R and D) research, and was conducted in two phases: (1) the phase of development
ani
validation
of
the
model,

and (2) the testing of the effectiveness and applicability of
the model. ln the first phase, the researcher used a developmental research model, whereas in
the second phase, he used a quasi-experimental pretest post-test control group non-random
design. The'subjects for the try out of the authentic assessment model were Physics teachers
and ihe students of state junior high schools (SMPN) in Bandar Lampung. The schools chosen
were SMPN 1, SMPN 12, and SMPN 18. They were all located in Bandar Lampung. One class
was selected from each of the three schools. The schools selected for the try out of the
effectiveness and applicability of the authentic assessment model were SMPN 14 and SMPN
22 Bandar Lampung. Two classes were selected from each of the two schools, one class as an
experimental group and the other as a control group. The result is in the form of an authentic
assessment modelwhich has been developed to assess the students'competencies in science
(physics). The competencies assessed by the model cover the assessment of conceptual
understanding, conceptualization, application, methodology, and affective, and holistic scores
shown by students' chart of competencies. The instruments of the research are the students'
sheet assessment (SSA), and observation sheets (OS), whose validity and reliability have been
tested. The validity and reliability of the instruments for the authentic assessment model are
shown by the results of the try out. The results indicated that there are no significant differences
among the raters in assessing the appropriateness of the components of the SSA and OS. The
inter raters' s@res also show the appropriateness among indicators and assignments of SSA
and OS in assessing the arrangement of the SSA. Furthermore, the results of the try out of the
effectiveness and applicability of the authentic assessment model showed that the
implementation of this model is effective in increasing the students' attitudes towards Physics,
the students' learning interest in Physics, the students' learning styles, and the students'
conceptual understanding of Physics. The change of the students' attitudes toward Physics,
their interest in learning Physics, their learning styles, and their conceptual understanding of
physics is more significant than that using the conventional assessment model.",,2009,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/8792,published,['L1'],Proceedding of the third International Seminar on Science Education,conference,758-770,Bandung,17 Oktober 2009,paper
