0,"The performance of constructed wetland and vegetated strip systems for swine wastewater treatment at Pontotoc/Flatwood Branch Experiment Station was  monitored  for  16 months, weekly  during summer and biweekly  in  other  seasons. A  laboratory  analysis  of  wastewater  constituents  was performed.  Constituent removal efficiencies were determined on  both  a  concentration  and  a  mass  basis.  Removal efficiencies varied among constituents.  overall concentration removals  of  BOD5,  SS,  NH3-N,  O-P04  ranged  from  about  63 %  to 94%.  overall mass removals of all constituents were more than 90%.  Fecal coliform removal was variable.  Overall hydraulic loss  of  83%  was  achieved.  The  open  water  segment  of  the wetland cells enhanced dissolved oxygen (D.O.)  concentration.",1993-12-01,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/45958,completed,['S1'],public,2022-10-25 06:52:35,unpub,7,Mississippi State University,disk0/00/04/59/58,['FP18'],832,2022-10-25 06:52:35,88,"[{'placement': 1, 'eprintid': 45958, 'pos': 1, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/184775', 'security': 'public', 'files': [{'objectid': 184775, 'filesize': 15577065, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/file/508855', 'filename': 'Cuplikan Thesis.pdf', 'hash_type': 'MD5', 'mtime': '2022-10-25 05:57:39', 'fileid': 508855, 'datasetid': 'document', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'hash': '4881d8758f8d48ab5c7626758883649c'}], 'main': 'Cuplikan Thesis.pdf', 'docid': 184775, 'format': 'text', 'language': 'en', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'rev_number': 1}]",2022-10-25 06:52:35,archive,45958,show,sugeng.triyono@fp.unila.ac.id,"[{'name': {'given': 'Sugeng', 'honourific': None, 'lineage': None, 'family': 'Triyono'}, 'id': 'sugeng.triyono@fp.unila.ac.id'}]",book,Performance of a Constructed Wetland in Swine Wastewater Treatment,FALSE
