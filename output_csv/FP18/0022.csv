This study aims to determine the effect of aggregate hydroponic 
growing media and EC (Electrical Conductivity) nutrient solution on the growth 
and production of melon (Cucumis melo L.). This study used Completely 
Randomized Design Factorial (CRD) with factorial arrangement consisting of 2 
factors, namely the type of planting medium (cocopeat and husk charcoal) and 
the EC value (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) mS/cm, each replicated as much as 3 times to obtain 
30 experimental units. The results showed that cocopeat was a planting medium 
that gave the best response on bases of the parameters of fruit weight and 
sweetness level with an average fruit weight of 2.46 kg, in addition the use of EC 
2 mS/cm and EC 3 mS/cm gave the best response to parameters of fruit weight 
and sweetness level with an average fruit weight of 2.04 kg and 2.05 kg. Based 
on these results, the use of EC 2 ms/cm was chosen as the best treatment, because 
it gives maximum results by spending less resources when compared to EC 3 
mS/cm.

water quality (temperature, pH, turbidity, ammonium) but was not significant for the yield of A. microphylla biomass. The factor of

a biomass yield of 804 g/m2 within 12-day cultivation.
