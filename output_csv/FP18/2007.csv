Biodiesel production is expected to grow steadily in the future. In converting vegetable oils into biodiesel,
approximately 10% (w/w) of glycerin is produced as a by-product. With the increasing production of biodiesel, there would be glut of glycerin in the world market; therefore, it is essential to find useful applications for this by-product. Glycerin is a potential feedstock for hydrogen production because one mole of glycerin can produce up to four moles of hydrogen. The objective of this study was to develop, test, and characterize promising catalysts for hydrogen production from steam reforming of glycerin. The following five catalysts were prepared on ceramic foam monoliths (92% Al2O3, 8% SiO2): rhodium-cerium, rhodium-cerium-platinum, ruthenium-yttrium, nickel, and iridium. The catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness technique. This article discusses selectivity data of the selected gases resulting from the glycerin steam reforming process. The study found that the rhodium-cerium-platinum catalyst was the most selective towards hydrogen under the experimental conditions investigated (700°C, 1 atm, and gas hourly specific velocity of 9.2 × 104 h−1).

drop/add management strategy to reduce groundwater use and effluent discharge in 
catfish ponds in the southeast U.S.. A drop/add approach is based on the creation of a 
storage volume in the pond for rainfall collection. The storage volume is created by 
allowing water level in the pond to decrease until some minimum level is reached. When 
the minimum level is reached, the pond is partly refilled, leaving the remaining volume 
available to capture incident precipitation. In this way, the role of precipitation in the 
water budget is increased. In the process, groundwater use and effluent release both 
become smaller. 
The data consisted of 45 year precipitation and evaporation records from 
Fairhope, AL; Clemson, SC; Stoneville, MS, Stuttgart, AR; and Thomsons, TX. The data 
were used in a water balance levee pond model that included precipitation, evaporation, 
infiltration, overflow, groundwater pumping, and draining. The model appeared to 
indicate that the drop/add management scheme is an effective strategy to reduce 
groundwater use and effluent discharge. 
The simulated results showed that variation of climate in the southeast U.S. was 
an important determinant of performance of the drop/add management scheme. At 
locations with positive P-0.8E, zero groundwater use could be achieved with low drop 
depths. At location with negative P-0.8E, zero groundwater use could be achieved for 
about 50% of the 45 simulated years. The model also indicated that effluent discharge 
cannot be avoided at most locations except at location with very low (negative) P-0.8E. 
The model also indicated that 65 to 100% of annual precipitation (depending on the P�0.8E’s of the locations) can be captured and used in the ponds. Rainwater contribution to 
the total water budget ranged from 90 to 100%. 
The sensitivity analysis showed that model sensitivity to pan coefficient and 
infiltration rate was affected by infiltration rate and pond water storage capacity (drop 
depth). The model was more sensitive to pan coefficient rather than to infiltration rate at 
lower infiltration rates and vice-versa. Both sensitivities of the model, however, 
increased when pond water deeper storage capacity was used.
