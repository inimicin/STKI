The aim of this research was to analyze the level of production’s efficiency   rice farming   and level of rice farming  income   in the technical  irrigation  land and in the rainfed.  The research  was done in Lampung Selatan  in  July  –  September  2014.  The  Location  of  research  was  done  in  the  District  of  Palas  with consideration of the area is rice production centers in Lampung. Collection data was  by using questionnaire and interview of the samples. Samples were taken  random, consisting of 33 rice farmers in irrigation lands technical  and  47  rice  farmers  in  rainfed.  Data  were  analyzed  using  frontier  production  function,  and analysis of farm income. The results showed that : (1) differences in the level of production’s efficiency of rice  farming  in  both  types  of  irrigation  between  technical  irrigation  land  and  rainfed.  The  level  of production’s efficiency in the planting season 1 by 76.33 percent for technical irrigation land and by 67,09 percent for rainfed. while in the planting season2  at the level of efficiency of technical irrigation land by 87,
81 percent and at rainfed by 69,26 percent. (2) Cash income of rice farmers planting season 1 and planting season 2 on technical irrigation land is greater than cash income rainfed rice farmers.
