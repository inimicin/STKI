One of the causes is the low productivity of the varieties grown due to the stagnant genetic capacity of these varieties. The assembly of new lines through breeding is one solution that can increase the genetic capacity of new varieties. Genetic diversity is one of the factors that influence the success of plant breeding. Ten new F9 rice lines were successfully assembled showing various phenotypes. The identification of the specific advantages of each of these new rice lines was based largely on the phenotypic response. The research objective was to identify the genetic advantages of each line through the analysis approach of genetic diversity coefficient (GDC), Phenotific Diversity Coefficient (PDC), and broad-sense heritability. The research was designed on a randomized completely block design (RCBD) with ten new F9 rice lines and two comparison varieties as treatments, repeated three times. The variables observed were plant height, maximum number of tillers, number of productive tillers, flowering time, harvesting time, panicle length, number of grain per panicle, number of filled grains per panicle, number of empty grain per panicle, grain length, grain width, grain thickness, and grain yield per hectare. The data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), if there was a difference between the mean values, it was continued with a 5% LSD test. The results showed that (i) the genotypes tested showed wide genetic and phenotypic diversity, (ii) based on the analysis of GDC, PDC, and broad sense heritability, the appearance of phenotypes of several agronomic characters was controlled by genetic factors",Society for Indonesian Biodiversity,['FP8'],Biodiversitas Journal of Biological Diversity,disk0/00/03/08/26,pub,18,2021-05-27 02:35:05,1412-033X,public,,,,,

Sekincau is a region in West Lampung with a great potential for horticulture productions; however until recently, Lampung depends on West Java for supplying of horticulture productions. Some community programs had been done consistently in this area by Agronomy faculties of Lampung University with the local agriculture extension and farmers groups.  The activities included:  introducing and developing good quality seeds of potato and baby beans seeds until certified for progeny of basic seed, intercropping of sorghum and baby beans, introducing internet applications useful for farmers and built a startup particularly for farmers.  The method was “training and visit” which for regions where the level of development is still very low, instructing farmers what to do was probably more appropriate. This paper evaluated university roles in disseminating innovation to farmers.  In general it can be concluded that community development and services would only effective if continually conducted by the same group and focused on certain chosen area.",,['FP8'],,disk0/00/03/18/55,submitted,8,2021-06-03 06:40:09,,public,"The Role of University Community Programs In Strengthening Agriculture Innovation And Researches Disseminations: A Case Study In Sekincau Region, West Lampung, Indonesia"" to the 1st International Conference on Assessment and Development of Agricultural In",conference,4 July 2021,paper,"Bogor, Indonesia"
