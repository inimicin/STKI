Auxin talcum treatment consisting  of 7 level of auxins concentrations, i.e., (in ppm) 0 (control), 2000 IBA, 4000 IBA, 2000 NAA, 4000 NAA, 1000 NAA + IBA 1000 and 2000 IBA + 2000 NAA in the form of talcum-paste were applied in the upper region of the girdled branches prior to being covered with soil medium. The results showed that after two months, all treatments containing NAA, either singly or in combination with IBA produced 100 % rooting, whereas the control treatment was only 22%. The IBA treatments singly at 2000 and 4000 ppm produced 44.4% and 55.6% rooting, respectively. The superiority of NAA upon IBA treatments was also shown by the higher number and length of primary roots as well as earlier root formation.

irradiation of embryogenic calli. The research was conducted at The Plant Laboratory, The University
of Lampung, Lampung, Indonesia in 2014. Leafrolls of sugarcane were cultured on callus-inducing
(CI) medium containing MS salts, 30 g L-1 sucrose, 100 mg L-1 myo-inositol, 150 m L-1 coconut water,
0.1 mg L-1 thiamine-HCl, 0.5 mg L-1 pyridoxine-HCl, 0.5 mg L-1 nicotinic acid, 2 mg L-1 glycine, and
3 mg L-1 2,4-D. The embryogenic calli were cultured on shoot-inducing (SI) medium which was the
same as the CI medium, except that the SI medium used 2.5 mg L-1 benzyladenine and no coconut
water. Shoots were rooted on root-inducing (RI) medium containing different concentrations of
indolebutyric acid (IBA) (0, 2, 5, 7.5, 10 mg L-1 ). The RI medium was the same as the SI medium
except for the plant growth regulators. The most effective IBA concentration for rooting of shoots was
5 mgL-1 . Plantlets with highest number of roots showed highest survival rate (68.4%). A radio
sensitivity study by irradiating embryogenic calli with gamma ray (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60

breeding of sugarcane.",Journal of ISSAAS,['FP8'],J. ISSAAS,disk0/00/00/53/71,pub,9,2018-11-14 02:45:35,public,0859-3132,htp:/www.issaas.org/journal/,,

superior robusta coffee clones in Lampung Province. The fifteen clones consisted of four clones released by the Indonesian Coffee and
Cocoa Research Institute (ICCRI), i.e. ‘BP 409’,‘BP936’, ‘BP939’, ‘SA 237’, together with eleven superior coffee clones selected by
farmers from Tanggamus District (‘Tugino’, ‘Wanto’, ‘Biyadi’, ‘Komari’, ‘Wardi’, ‘Wariso’) and from West Lampung District (‘Tugu
Kuning’, ‘Tugu Hijau', ‘Tugu Biru', ‘Tugu Sari', ‘Lengkong'). Fifteen qualitative and seven quantitative morphological characters were
evaluated in a randomized complete block design with three replicates for each clone,each replication consisted of two plants. From
each plant, four samples were taken from four sides of the plant (north, south, west, and east). It was found that while some
morphological characters exhibited negligible variation among clones, there were significant differences between clones for other
characters. The characters that did not differ significantly between clones were: shapes of leaf base and leaf tip; petiole color; leaf
venation pattern; fruit disk shape; ripe-fruit color; and stipule shape. The characters that varied between clones were shape of leaf lamina
(elliptical vs. lanceolate); fruit shape (round vs. oval); and shape of leaf margins. Morphological variation was also observed in some
quantitative characters: canopy diameter; tree height; stem diameter; leaf length; leaf width; petiole length; stipule length; and number of
primary branches.",Society for Indonesian Biodiversity,['FP8'],Biodiversitas Journal of Biological Diversity,disk0/00/00/98/49,pub,6,2018-11-14 02:48:18,public,1412-033X,http:/biodiversitas.mipa.uns.ac.id,[{'url': 'http:/biodiversitas.mipa.uns.ac.id'}],DOI: 10.13057/biodiv/d190438
