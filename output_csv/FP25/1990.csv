Forty-five F2-derived·F6 families of two crosses, AR-4/NC 7 and GFA-2/NC 7, were evaluated us1ng a randomized complete block design with three replica- tions. To evaluate DSR, sterilized rehydrated seed were i~oculated by a spore suspension of Aspergillus parasiticus strain NRRL 2999 (5 X 10 spore/ml}. Percent
infection was recorded after 8 days of incubation at 25 C. To evaluate APR, the seed coat was removed from five seeds which were then sterilized, rehydrated, inoculated, and incubated for ¥ days at 29 C. Samples were analyzed using an HPLC to determine aflatoxin production. Plants of each family were evaluated for PIR in the greenhouse and inoculated at 40 days after planting (OAP}. Drought stress was applied at 60 OAP to induce A:. parasiticus infection. Seeds from each plant were harvested, dried, and plated in malt salt agar, and the percent infection was recorded after 8 days. In cross AR-4/NC 7, heritability estimates of DSR, APR, and PIR were 0.55±0.23, 0.20±0.25, and 0.27±0.25, with family means ranging from 7-95%, 7.95-43.62 ppm, and 0-100%, respectively. In cross GFA-2/NC 7, heritability estimates of DSR, APR, and PIR were 0.63±0.21, 0.47±0.22, and 0.33±0.26, with family means ranging from 25-98%, 14.73-69.62 ppm, and 0-100%, respectively. The means of the three traits in cross AR-4/NC 7 were generally lower than those of cross GFA-2/NC 7. In both crosses, there was no significant correlation among the three mechanisms of resistance, indicating that the three mechanisms are controlled by different genes. Selections from cross GFA-2/NC 7 should produce a larger number of progenies with resistance than selections using AR-4/NC 7."
