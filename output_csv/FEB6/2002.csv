mutual funds based on returns and risk, and also
classify the efficientcyof mutual funds based on the
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) method. The
researchâ€™ sample was 44 conventional equity mutual
funds, 9 sharia equity mutual funds, 44 sharia fixed
income mutual funds, and 9 sharia fixed income
mutual funds. The research period is from 2017 to
2018. The results show that the rate of return and risk
between conventional mutual funds and sharia
mutual funds are the same or have no difference.
While the calculation of the rate of return and risk
between equity funds and fixed income mutual funds
also shows that there are no differences between the
two types of mutual funds. The classification of
efficient mutual funds found that there were 15
equityfunds and 40 fixed income mutual funds which
were included in efficient mutual funds.
