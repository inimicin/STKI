matching the internal potential or organizational resources with external business
opportunities. This field of study is frequently done the testing of propositions regarding
the effort in making sure strategic implementation successfully. However when the
alignment is related to strategic control, model of dinamyc strategic fit can be better in
achieving the performance, as it is explained by following propositions:1) firm strategies
contribute better result when it can anticipate the changing environment, such as
consumer preferences, government policy, competitor movement, technological change
and other shift, this alignment is called beneficial strategic change (dynamic fit); 2) firm
strategies that cannot anticipate the environmental change, called insufficient strategic
change misfit, cannot contribute good performance; 3) the existing chosen strategies,
that fit with the changing environment, called beneficial inertia dynamic fit, can
contribute the performance; and finally, 4) firms, with existing chosen strategies that fit
with the changing environment, to some extent has introduced a strategic change that
actually does not fit with the environment, lead to poor performance. The alignment is
called excessive change dynamic misfit, because cannot contribute any good the
performance.

An Experimental Approach",http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/2925,2008,['H1'],,published,2017-06-02 03:59:03,public,pub,6,['FEB6'],disk0/00/00/29/25,,13.0,"Research in psychology suggests that less informed individuals may suffer from
overconfidence. Empirical research shows that overconfident investors tend to overvalue the
price of the securities so that they unconsciously buy the security at a higher price or sell the
security at a lower price than its fundamental value leading to transaction losses. As an
experimental research project, this paper addresses these issues. According to the research
design, all investors are classified into three groups based on their scores of overconfidence, 
namely the less informed investors, the rational (average) investors, and the more informed 
investors. In order to observe the responses of the groups of investors when they receive
valuable information, the research employs four different types of treatments consisting of
the condition of no market information, the provision of guidance of security prediction, the
good news and the bad news. The research findings demonstrate that the less informed
investors are inclined to assess the precision of their knowledge and information excessively
so that they produce a higher mean of prediction and price errors than those of the more
informed investors in all experimental market sessions, except in the market session of good
news. The phenomenon indicates that less informed investors conduct a self deceptive
behavior. The result of the research also shows that less informed investors do not always
suffer from transaction losses although they have a higher mean of prediction or price errors
than those of the more informed investors. The less informed investors have a chance to
gain profit as long as they are able to deliver the predicted value of the security accurately
which is closer to the market price that reflects the expected price of the majority of the
market players.
