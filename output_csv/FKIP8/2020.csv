Various Indonesian local wisdom has been used as teaching material in the classroom. However, pepaccur local wisdom is still rarely known and used as teaching material.
Therefore it is a novelty to turn pepaccur local wisdom into Indonesian literary teaching materials. This study aims to investigate the properness of pepaccur local wisdom for Indonesian literary teaching materials. The qualitative approach used in this study is characterized by collecting data through interviews, observation, recording and book review, and other sources related to pepaccur local
wisdom. Content analyses were also used in analyzing the collected data. The results of this study are in the form of pepaccur presentations that are appropriate to be used as teaching materials for Indonesia language and literature based on the characteristics of the functions and values of local wisdom contained in them. Values contained in pepaccur such as religion, simplicity, cooperation, and politeness can be a reference in behaving in the community and this integration can be an effort to preserve local wisdom that has begun to be abandoned by the Lampung community. Implications from this study, through pepaccur-based teaching materials, students can learn to live a simple life, have a
community with mutual help and respect, and learn poetic arts to provide entertainment and advice",9,2020-06-01 00:00:00.000000000,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/33330,Jurnal Pendidikan Indonesia (JPI),['FKIP8'],disk0/00/03/33/30,public,"p-ISSN: 2303-288X, e-ISSN: 2541-7207",2021-08-05 09:08:36,pub,10,,,Jurnal Pendidikan Indonesia (JPI)

Besides infrastructure, teachersâ€™ ability to integrate technology in learning is also an important factor that affects the success of online learning.

Thus, this research aims to explore the Indonesian language teachersâ€™ TPCK and readiness to conduct online learning during the COVID-19 outbreak. This research applied a survey method with 318 participating teachers in Lampung, Indonesia. The data were collected using questionnaires related to attitude, technological knowledge, content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, pedagogical content
knowledge, technological content knowledge, technological pedagogical knowledge, and technological pedagogical content knowledge. They were then analyzed quantitatively using factor analysis and qualitatively based on the teachersâ€™ answers to learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results demonstrate that Indonesian language teachers have adapted to the implementation of online learning related to the use of technology such as the variety of learning media and educational platforms used as well as TPCK skills. In general, teachersâ€™ TPCK tends to be positive about online learning even though some senior teachers have a negative attitude to the technological aspects. They have difficulty using technology in learning so that the class looks monotonous and does not vary.

Heuristic, hermeneutic, and intertextual reading methods were performed eclectically to analyze the content, values, and language styles in literary texts. Literary texts that become the focus of the study were those written by pesantren-based writers i.e. poems written by Gus Mus, Ahmad Tohari's short
stories, and Habiburrahman El Shirazy's novels. This study found that the imagination and creativity of the literature written by pesantren-based writers tend to be identical with the commitment and quality of the creator's religiosity. It can be implied that the aspects of religiosity and the atmosphere of pesantren that can blow up the imagination and creativity in literary processing can be adopted to support literacy learning and literary processing by public educational institutions outside the pesantren.",3,1970-01-01 00:00:00.000002020,http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/33329,International Journal of Education and Social Science Research,['FKIP8'],disk0/00/03/33/29,public,ISSN 2581-5148,2021-08-05 09:08:31,pub,11,,,International Journal of Education and Social Science Research
