However, to our best knowledge, little is known about how they acquire and apply these skills in real-life situations outside of the classroom, among communities through student community service program in particular. In other words, because empirical evidence in the literature has failed to recognise the implementation of prospective teachers’ generic skills among communities, the question on this topic remains open. Therefore, our purpose was to explore and describe prospective teachers’ generic skills when taking part
in a community service program. This study is qualitative in nature, with a total of 150 students consisting of
100 females (67%) and 50 males (33%) enrolled at the Faculty of Teacher Training and Education in a public
university in Indonesia participating by adopting a questionnaire and audio-recorded interviews for data
collection. The data collected through questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive statistics, while the
information collected through the interviews was evaluated and interpreted using content analysis through
coding classification and theme or pattern identification, with the goal of providing thorough descriptive
interpretations of social phenomena. The findings reveal that the prospective teachers under investigation
strongly agree and agree that community service program has benefited them personally, socially, and professionally, as well as improved their generic skills. They could develop their generic skills while participating in a student community service program. The findings of this study provide clear evidence that generic skills and the development of these skills are deemed important by students enrolled at teacher training and education. Based on the findings, the implications and limitations of this present study with several suggestions for future research are also discussed.",['L1'],,8,unpub,2022-03-23 04:34:13,public,['FKIP10'],FKIP Universitas Lampung,disk0/00/04/04/36,"[{'eprintid': 40436, 'placement': 1, 'security': 'public', 'pos': 1, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/161748', 'format': 'text', 'files': [{'hash': '589ac8d7b349d835303fcd5615510313', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'fileid': 450923, 'datasetid': 'document', 'mtime': '2022-03-23 03:34:40', 'hash_type': 'MD5', 'filename': 'Prospective Teachers, Generic Skills, a...

has caused the entire learning system in educational institutions to be shifted to online (online) methods. The 
implementation of online learning that is too long has an impact on students' learning motivation. Too long a time 
makes students bored because almost every day they have to sit in front of devices such as smartphones, laptops, and so 
on to access online learning. The policy of studying at home demands a high motivation from students to learn, while 
what is happening at this time is a decline in student learning motivation. In this case, the teacher is required to be able 
to use technology in order to continue the continuity of teaching. Online learning media in the form of ""E-Learning 
Media Portal for Home Learning Kemdikbud"" is one solution in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic to increase student 
learning motivation. This study aims to explain the benefits of E-Learning to increase students' learning motivation. 
This study uses a quantitative phenomenological approach and uses an interactive model of Miles & Huberman. Data 
were collected through in-depth interviews, observations, and questionnaires. The results showed an increase in 
students' learning motivation in social studies lessons by utilizing five features in the Learning House Portal such as: 
Learning resources, Electronic School Books (BSE), Question Banks, Cultural Maps, and Maya Classes (google meet 
and zoom meetings) as one of the Learning Resources. However, it also has obstacles from several factors such as the 
unpreparedness of students in the distance learning process, the conditions of the learning environment that are not 
conducive, the condition of the parents of students, the lack of support for facilities provided by parents, and the 
psychological state of students which includes: talent, intelligence, attitudes, perceptions, and interests are also factors 
of student success in learning.

understood or not. This must be done because teachers are required to be ready to anticipate, face
challenges, and solve problems that occur in the learning process even though online. The purpose of this

The research method used was qualitative descriptive with Miles and Huberman data analysis techniques.
Data was collected through interviews, documentation, and observation. The results showed that the
learning behavior of social studies teachers at SMPN 33 Bandarlampung was not optimal in distance learning activities, because teachers were less varied in using teaching materials and learning media, so students were not very active during distance learning and students' social studies learning outcomes were not maximized.

This distinction is often measured by domination, marginalization, majority or minority, and even stereotypes attached to each group or ethnicity. Not infrequently also formed a pattern that labels a local community and migrants. The complexity of inter-ethnic relations in multicultural societies requires controlling models for the relations with conflict potential. Actually, the concept of ethnic
identity still leaves debate that is not over, especially among experts in the social
sciences. However, at least we need to get an overview of this construct. One of the strongest elements in the cultural structure of a society that can support multicultural relationships that are equilibrium and harmony is kinship because there is a mechanism in maintaining wholeness. This study aims to reveal the meaning of kinship commodification in local ethnic groups in Lampung and
reveal the implicit meaning of the commodification of kinship. As a qualitative study, interviews were the main instrument for obtaining a native perspective (the giver and recipient of a title) and observing the custom ritual of awarding the title holistically and supported by several relevant documents. Collected data by rolling out information on some (original) informants to get their perspective on the culture of lifting titles for migrants who used a kinship perspective. This study also used participatory observation to get a complete picture of the
commodification of kinship in multicultural relationships. The research location included the Lampung society dominated by Papadun and Saibatin communities. The results showed that the positioning of Lampung ethnicity at the minority level
in a multicultural society increased their ability to cultivate a title culture in their community structure as a tool of resistance by adopting kinship. Cultural actions
with kinship patterns and symbols make other people like relatives or family. Even the title becomes an instrument of cultural harmony in multicultural relations. The title of Lampung’s local ethnic kinship becomes the identity at stake because the title found a compromise of identity that is always modified.",['GN'],completed,7,unpub,2022-03-23 04:34:25,public,['FKIP10'],FKIP Universitas Lampung,disk0/00/04/04/46,"[{'pos': 1, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/161759', 'security': 'public', 'placement': 1, 'eprintid': 40446, 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'language': 'en', 'rev_number': 1, 'main': 'The Kinship Commodification of Local Ethnic in.pdf.pdf', 'files': [{'fileid': 450996, 'datasetid': 'document', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'hash': '8cbc762fd3608f5088fdd900e054ea2f', 'objectid': 161759, 'filesize': 333281, 'filename': 'The Kinship Commodification of Local Ethnic in.pdf.pdf', 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/file/450996', 'hash_type': 'MD5', 'mtime': '2022-03-23 04:26:53'}], 'docid': 161759, 'format': 'text'}]",https://www.folkloredebiyat.org/Makaleler/770644176_108.12.makale%20Risma%20M.Sinaga%20(The%20Kinship%20Commodification).pdf,2022-03-23 04:34:25,[{'type': 'http://www.loc.gov/loc.terms/relators/AUT'}],820,show,archive,40446,2022-03-23 04:34:25,Similarity Check: The Kinship Commodification of Local Ethnic in  Lampung in Multicultural Relations,"[{'name': {'honourific': None, 'lineage': None, 'family': 'Sinaga', 'given': 'Risma Margaretha'}, 'id': 'sinaga_rmargaretha@yahoo.com'}]",other,,,,,,,
