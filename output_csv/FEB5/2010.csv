research
was
conducted
in
Tanggamus
to
find
commodity
coffee
marketing
chain.
The
major
problem
in
the
coffee
marketing
chain
in
Tanggamus
is
still
vreak
bargaining
power
of
farmers
in
selling
their
coffee
production
to
the
dealer.
Suspected
as
the
main
cause
of
inefficiency
is
not
yet
integrated
trading
system
and
market.
Therefore,
this
study
tries
to
examine
the
efficiency
of
the
coffee
marketing
by
researching
on
marketing
channels
and
market
integration.
The
result
indicates
that
the
commodity
coffee
market
channels
in
the
district
Tanggamus
consists
of
two
types,
namely:
a.
Tipel
Farmers
sell
to
Trader
Mllage
Collector,
Collector
Traders
Village
District
to
sell
to
traders,
and
then
sellto
exporters,
traders
district
b.
Type
2
farmers
sell
to
traders
Collector
Village,
Traders
Village
Collectors
subsequently
sold
to
exporters
.
None
of
the
above
marketing
channels
uses
Timmer
model
approach.
This
shows
that
are
not
yet
integrated
with
the
perfect
market.
As
a
result
the
farmers
are
always
experiencing
delays
in
receiving
price
increases,
and
vice
versa
more
quicklyrin
accepting
the
price
decline.
Though
statistically
the
price
linkage
between
marketing
institutions
closely
enough.
From
these
findings
suggested
that
the
farmers
formed
an\titution
that
can
access
market
information
and
capable
of
interrupting
the
marketing
chaln
in
order
to'begome
