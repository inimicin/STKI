The battle has the opportunity to increase some food commodity prices, thus hampering the total imports carried out. In addition, other leading commodities (non-oil and gas) such as gold, oil, and coal will also experience significant turmoil due to the conflict that has continued to heat up recently. The study provides an overview of the systemic impact on Indonesia's economic conditions by predicting the short-term possibilities. This study investigates the Russia-Ukraine conflict's initial estimate of the net import value of the two countries and other trading partners.

This research aims to find out the long-term and short-term effects of the oil price variable on the exchange rate, as well as the variables of foreign 
exchange reserves, relative money supply, relative GDP, and interest rates relative to the exchange rate in Indonesia. The analytical method used is the 
error correction model (ECM). This study’s results indicate a significant adverse effect between the variables of foreign exchange reserves, relative 
GDP, and relative interest rates on exchange rates in the long term and short term. There is an insignificant positive relationship between oil prices 
and the exchange rate in the long term and a significant positive relationship in the short term. There is a negligible negative effect between the money 
supply relative to the exchange rate in the long term and an essential negative relationship in the short term.

even more complex when coupled with competitiveness between countries and democratic systems. So this

interesting finding is that democracy negatively affects global competitiveness and increases economic growth. 
This research can be one of the government's policy recommendations by increasing economic growth through 
strict enforcement against corruption and increasing global competitiveness. To realize economic growth that

support other competitiveness factors that focus on technological, environmental, and innovation aspects.
