This research was aimed to describe the views of Islamic school physics teachers on the importance of. Augmented Reality-assisted worksheet teaching materials in facilitating students' involvement in the learning process This research involved 31 Islamic high school physics teachers in Lampung Province. Indonesia. The explanatory design mixed methods were used in this research. The results showed that the Augmented Reality-assisted worksheet could increase potentially student involvement in physics learning diuing the pandemic by implementing a learning management system smted to students' learning needs and facilities. The results of this research also illustrated the importance of designing worksheets that support the effectiveness of online learning during the COYID-19 pandemic.,['Universitas Lampung'],,,,,,

The research used mixed methods, which consisted of qualitative data and quantitative data. This research involved 76 respondents spread across several schools in Lampung Province. Based on the preliminary study conducted, it was known that the majority of students want to use STEM-integrated PjBL-based E-Modules as a learning resource with a percentage of 61.9%, while the use of E-Modules as a learning resource used by teachers is still low at only 9.5 %. The preliminary study also saw that the E-Module that was developed later could measure problem-solving abilities with a percentage of 52.4%. Based on this, the use of E-Modules as a learning resource is needed by students, so it is necessary to conduct a needs analysis for the development of an E-Module based on STEM integrated PjBL to improve problem-solving abilities in light refraction material.",['Universitas Lampung'],,,,,,

made learning resources assisted by the integration between STEM and augmented reality technology. The teachers also revealed that they were anxious that the learning resources that they will use cannot fully meet the competency standards if they are not equipped with learning technology that supports the abstract concepts learning.

The hypothesis says that accretion reduces the magnetic field in a neutron star. The correlation between accretion and decrease in the magnetic field is indicated by the magnitude of the magnetic field dynamics and the mass accretion rate. The purpose of this research is to formulate the mass rate of accretion in rapidly rotating neutron stars. The accretion disc is assumed to be at the equator. The method used is theoretical-mathematical analysis. The quantities to be summarized are the Killing vector, 4-vector velocity, the angular velocity, and the Lorentz gamma factor derived from the metric. The metric used is a rapidly rotating neutron star. The rate of mass accretion is calculated from these quantities and the equation for mass sustainability. The equation of mass accretion rate is derived from these variables and the mass conservation equation. The equation of mass accretion rate is affected by the radial velocity of accretion flows and distance between matter and center of a neutron star. The result obtained is covariant with the equation of mass accretion rate for Kerr black holes. The results obtained can provide a dynamic equation for the magnetic field to produce an equation for the decrease in the magnetic field in a rapidly rotating neutron star.","['Universitas Negeri Malang', 'Universitas Lampung']",,,,,,
