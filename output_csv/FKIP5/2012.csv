Indonesia. We use the General Decision-making Style instrument, the Job
Satisfaction Survey and a demographic questionnaire developed for this study.
Our findings show that: 12 out of the 15 relationships tested were significant;
rational, intuitive, dependent and avoidant decision-making styles were significant predictors of teacher job satisfaction; and these are still significant predictors
after the possible effects of gender, marital status, teacher certification and school
location are controlled for",['Universitas Lampung'],2012-10-09,TRUE,214,5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13632434.2012.723617,"[{'format': 'text', 'main': 'Hariri 2012 Principalship in an Indonesian school context.pdf', 'docid': 897, 'files': [{'datasetid': 'document', 'fileid': 6432, 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'hash': 'f05b95cf5a8c6cbb31eeea54b75bdc1f', 'objectid': 897, 'filesize': 142070, 'filename': 'Hariri 2012 Principalship in an Indonesian school context.pdf', 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/file/6432', 'hash_type': 'MD5', 'mtime': '2016-10-30 13:35:35'}], 'rev_number': 2, 'language': 'en', 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'eprintid': 519, 'placement': 1, 'security': 'staffonly', 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/897', 'pos': 1}]",2016-09-03 08:05:21,519,"Alghabban, A. 2001.
