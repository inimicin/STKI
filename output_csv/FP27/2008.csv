difference (DCAD) on acidity of ration, blood, vaginal mucous, and urine, number of
fetus, number of offspring, and offspring sex ratio. The treatments were rations with
DCAD -28, -18, 0, +14, and +32 meq which were offered to 15 ewes. This research used
randomized complete block design. There were three groups, (I) ewes previously had
twin female offsprings; (II) ewes previously had twin male offsprings; and (III) ewes
previously had twin male and female offsprings. Results of this study showed that there
were no differences observed for blood’s pH, vaginal liquid’s pH, offspring number,
and offspring sex ratio. Increasing DCAD affected ration’s pH, urine’s pH, and number
of fetus for each ewe. Blood’s acidity was not affected by DCAD, but DCAD -28 meq
reduced acid of blood, metabolic acidosis, and urine; the number of fetus and offspring.
DCAD -28 meq might be anions excessive in the ration. DCAD 0 meq was relatively the
best of ration because gave the normality of blood, metabolic, and urine, also relatively
the highest of fetus and offspring. The offspring sex ratio related to vaginal mucose pH
when artifi cial insemination was applied (r= 0.75) and ration’s pH (r=0.47). Ewes previously
had twin female lambs gave the number of fetus and offspring sex ratio were
2.00+0.71 and 0%, respectively. Ewes previously had twin male lambs gave the number
of fetus and offspring sex ratio were 2.80+1.30 and 15.00+8.50%, respectively. Ewes
previously had twin male and female lambs gave the number of fetus and offspring sex
ratio were 1.60+1.14 and 61.75+31.50%, respectively.
