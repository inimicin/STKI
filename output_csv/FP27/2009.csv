Rations with DCAD value of -28, -18,0, +14, and +32 mEq were offered to15 ewes in a randomized complete block design.  On day 21, blood samples were taken anaerobically using heparinized syringes from the coccygeal jugular venipuncture.  Each syringe was capped and placed on ice immediately following collection to determine on plasma Na, K, Cl, Ca, P concentration.
The DCAD value hadno effect on plasma Na, K, Cl, and P concentration indicating that here was homeostasis to maintain the physiological status of the body.  The DCAD value of -18, 0, +14, and +32 mEq resulted in the normal blood with Na:K ratiso closed to 20:1.  Plasma Cl concentration was associated with plasma Na, but the concentration of Cl was lower than of Na.
Th e DCAD values significantly influencd P urine, but had no effect on urinary Na, K, Cl, S and Ca.  The Dcad value of -28 and -18 mEq resulted in the low acidity of urine at level of 5.73±0.20 and 5.84±0,27, respectively.  The DCAD value of 0, +14, and +32 mEq resulted in normal urinary pH.
Rations with DCAD values of -18, 0,+14, and +32 mEq in garut ewes had normal ratio of plasma”s Na+ : K+ and were able to perform regulation of minerals control inside their blood to be homeostatis, and some excessive minerals would be secreted through urine. Ration with DCAD valus of -28 and -18 mEq in garut ewes had the highest ratio of plasma’s ca2+ : P2- wich was 2.2:1.0, so it could be used as an action to prevent milk fever.
