Sample were taken by using random sampling technique as many as 56 students of SD Negeri 2 Langkapura. Data were collected through questionnaires and test questions. Questionnaire is  used  to  measure the feasibility of students  worksheets and  test questions to  measure the improvement of student learning outcomes. The results showed that students worksheet based on discovery learning were developed feasible and effective for learning. This is proved from the results of the acquisition of
