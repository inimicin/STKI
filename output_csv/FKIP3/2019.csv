developing integrative thematic learning tools based on Problem Based Learning in improving students' critical
thinking. This type of research is research and development that refers to Borg and Gall theory. The population
of this study was the fourth-grade students of elementary schools in Argomulyo Village, Banjit District, and the
sample was determined by a purposive sampling of 27 students. Data were collected through observation sheets,
questionnaires, and test questions. The test instrument that used able to fulfills validity and reliability, taking into
account the level of difficulty, and the different power of the questions. The data analysis technique used is the
n-Gain test to determine its effectiveness. The results of validating thematic learning tools based on Problem
Based Learning are done by curriculum experts and learning experts. The results showed that the product
development of integrated thematic learning tools based on Problem Based Learning produced is effective for 
use in the learning process for fourth-grade students. This is proved by the increase in student learning outcomes
and students' critical thinking skills after using an integrative thematic learning tool based on Problem Based
Learning.

The type of research used is research and development that refers to the theory of Borg & Gall. The population in this study included fourth grade students in elementary schools in central Lampung. The sampling technique uses a purposive technique. The sample of this study was fourth grade students, amounting to 44 elementary schools in Central Lampung. Data was collected through questionnaires and tests. The feasibility of the instrument is theoretically based on the assessment of 3 experts with an average of 84.32 very good categories. While the feasibility of the instrument empirically based on the analysis there are 30 decent and quality MCQs from the results of validity, reliability, distinguishing power, level of difficulty, and distractor test. The results of the study showed that the test instruments developed had met the criteria for writing proper and quality test instruments to measure students' knowledge.
