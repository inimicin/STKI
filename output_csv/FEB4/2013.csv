Chief Executive Officer (CEO) turnover is in line with the change in ownership
structure. Data of CEO is collected originally from all companies in Indonesia
during 1999–2007. The CEO substitution of selected companies was only taken
until the turnover to the year 2003, and during the four years after the turn was
never replaced. The result from our study cannot find the relationship between
corporate ownership changes and CEO turnover in Indonesia. However, the
study finds a statistically significant result on the relationship between CEO
turnover and accounting performance. Furthermore, the result of study also
showed that the companies with poor performance over several years before
turnover tended to choose a new CEO from external, rather than the corporate
with relatively good financial performance. The owners expect the CEO
successor from external parties can bring changes to the company through new
policies.

Principle learning process using two different method; mathematics-based method and conventional
method, (2) to find an empirical evidence whether an alternatives mathematics-based method is
eligible to be implemented in accounting learning.
This study is a quasi-experimental research with non-equivalent control group design. The subject of
this research is high school student. The participant in total 60 students comes from BPK Penabur
Senior High School as a control group, and Perintis 2 Senior High School Bandarlampung as an
experiment group.
The independent t-test result shows that student learning achievement using mathematics-based
method is statistically equal with conventional method in both competencies; debit or credit
positioning and transaction analyzing. The equality of learning achievement in both group shows that
mathematics-based method is eligible to be implemented in accounting learning process. The
