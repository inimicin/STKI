0,"Indonesia became an area passed by the Pacific Ring of Fire which was the meeting place of 
two active tectonic plates, which caused Indonesia to have many volcanoes. One of them is Mount 
Merapi. Mount Merapi is located on the border between Central Java and the Special Region of 
Yogyakarta, which is located at 7o32.5'LS and 110o26.5'W with an altitude of 2,978 diameters of 28 km, 
an area of 300-400 km2
and a volume of 150 km3
. Merapi is a stratovolcano-type volcano with a coneï¿½shaped andesite-basaltic type of magma. Seismic method aims to find out more the characteristics of the 
volcano. One indicator to see the early possibility of eruption is the occurrence of volcanic type 
earthquake (VTA) which is then accompanied by the emergence of shallow volcanic type earthquake 
(VTB). Volcanic earthquake data of Mount Merapi which can be as many as 5 volcanic earthquake 
events in the period of August 18, 2017 to August 31, 2017. Hypocenter points obtained have varying 
depth at different times. The accuracy of hyposenter points can be influenced by the picking results of the 
arrival time of the primary wave. We can conclude that in the period August 18, 2017 to August 31, 2017 
is a type of deep volcanic earthquake.",http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/eprint/52041,3018,"The 43 rd Annual Scientific Meeting of Himpunan Ahli Geofisika Indonesia  Semarang, 24-27 September 2018  Determination of Volcanic Earthquake Hypocenter on Period 18 until",['TN'],public,2023-05-29 01:33:04,8,pub,['FT1'],disk0_bak/00/05/20/41,conference,1070,2023-05-29 01:33:04,"[{'format': 'text', 'main': 'Determination of Volcanic Earthquake Hypocenter on Period 18 until 31 August 2017  Case Study of Mount Merapi, Yogyakarta, Indonesia_2.pdf', 'docid': 251796, 'files': [{'filesize': 578831, 'objectid': 251796, 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/file/616602', 'filename': 'Determination of Volcanic Earthquake Hypocenter on Period 18 until 31 August 2017  Case Study of Mount Merapi, Yogyakarta, Indonesia_2.pdf', 'hash_type': 'MD5', 'mtime': '2023-05-28 08:14:31', 'datasetid': 'document', 'fileid': 616602, 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'hash': '2290aebeef8497bcff3e03456eaac934'}], 'mime_type': 'application/pdf', 'language': 'en', 'rev_number': 1, 'eprintid': 52041, 'placement': 1, 'security': 'public', 'uri': 'http://repository.lppm.unila.ac.id/id/document/251796', 'pos': 1}]",2023-05-29 01:33:04,52041,archive,show,Semarang,paper,conference_item,"[{'name': {'family': 'Suharno', 'lineage': None, 'honourific': None, 'given': 'Suharno'}, 'id': 'suharno@eng.unila.ac.id'}]","Determination of Volcanic Earthquake Hypocenter on Period 18 until 31 August 2017 Case Study of Mount Merapi, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",TRUE,24-27 September 2018
